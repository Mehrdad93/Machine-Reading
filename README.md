# Machine-Reading
The project is intended to Parse TEI-XML formatted book files, extracted information of interest out of it (e.g. Named Entities, Time tags, etc.), and transform all the books into three disjoint sets of train/test/dev, ready to be fed to any NER model working with CoNLL 2003 format.
