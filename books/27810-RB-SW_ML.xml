    <head>DIRECTIONS AND INFORMATION <lb/>
     FOR<lb/>
    THE TOURIST.</head>
    <p>IN preparing this Manual, it was the Author's principal wish to furnish a Guide or Companion for the <emph>Minds</emph> of Persons of taste, and feeling for Landscape, who might
     be inclined to explore the District of the Lakes with that degree of attention to which its beauty may fairly lay claim. For the more sure attainment, however, of this primary
     object, he will begin by undertaking the humble and tedious task of supplying the <roleName>Tourist</roleName> with directions how to approach the several scenes in their best, or most convenient,
     order. But first, supposing the approach to be made from the south, and through <placeName>Yorkshire</placeName>, there are certain interesting spots which may be confidently recommended to his notice,
     if time can be spared before entering upon <placeName>the Lake District</placeName> ; and the route may be changed in returning.</p>
    <p rend='indent'>There are three approaches to the Lakes through <placeName>Yorkshire</placeName> ; the least adviseable is the</p>

    <p>DIRECTIONS AND INFORMATION</p>
    <p>great north road by <placeName>Catterick</placeName> and <placeName>Greta Bridge</placeName>, and onwards to <placeName>Penrith</placeName>. The <roleName>Traveller</roleName>, however, taking this route, might halt at <placeName>Greta Bridge</placeName>, and be well recompenced if he can 
     afford to give an hour or two to the banks of the <placeName>Greta</placeName>, and of the Tees, at <placeName>Rokeby</placeName>. <placeName>Barnard Castle</placeName> also, about two miles up the Tees, is a striking object, and the main North Road
     might be rejoined at <placeName>Bowes</placeName>. Everyone has heard of the great fall of the Tees above <placeName>Middleham</placeName>, interesting for its grandeur, as the avenue of rocks that leads to it, is to the
     geologist. But this place lies so far out of the way as scarcely to be within the compass of our notice. It might, however, be visited by a <roleName>Traveller</roleName> on foot, or on horseback, who 
     could rejoin the main road upon <placeName>Stanemoor</placeName>.</p>
    <p rend='indent'>The second road leads through a more interesting tract of country, beginning at <placeName>Ripon</placeName>, from which place see <placeName>Fountain's Abbey</placeName>, and thence by <placeName>Hackfall</placeName>, and <placeName>Masham</placeName>, to <placeName>Jervaux Abbey</placeName>,
     and up <placeName>the vale of Wensley</placeName>; turning aside before <placeName>Askrigg</placeName> is reached, to see <placeName>Aysgarth-force</placeName>, upon the <placeName>Ure</placeName>; and again, near <placeName>Hawes</placeName>, to <placeName>Hardraw Scar</placeName>, of which, with its waterfall, <persName>Turner</persName> has a 
    fine drawing. Thence over the fells to <placeName>Sedbergh</placeName>, and <placeName>Kendal</placeName></p>
    <p rend='indent'>The third approach from <placeName>Yorkshire</placeName> and <placeName>Addington</placeName> to <placeName>Bolton Bridge</placeName>, for the</p>

    <p><seg type='pagenumber'>iii</seg></p>
    <p>FOR THE TOURIST.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>sake of visiting the Abbey and grounds. It would be well, however, for a party previously to secure beds, if wanted, at the inn, as there is but one, and it is much resorted to in summer.</p>
    <p rend='indent'>   The <roleName>Traveller</roleName> on foot, or horseback, would do well to follow the banks of the Wharf upwards, to <placeName>Burnsall</placeName>, and thence cross over the hills to Gordale â€” a noble scene, 
     beautifully described in Gray's Tour, and with which no one can be disappointed. Thence to <placeName>Malham</placeName>, where there is a respectable village inn, and so on, by <placeName>Malham Cove</placeName>, to <placeName>Settle</placeName>.</p>
    <p rend='indent'>   Travellers in carriages must go from <placeName>Bolton Bridge</placeName> to <placeName>Skipton</placeName>, where they rejoin the main road; and should they be inclined to visit <placeName>Gordale</placeName>, a tolerable road turns off
     beyond <placeName>Skipton</placeName>. Beyond <placeName>Settle</placeName>, under <placeName>Giggles wick Scar</placeName>, the road passes an ebbing and flowing well, worthy the notice of the <roleName>Naturalist</roleName>. Four miles to the right of <placeName>Ingleton</placeName>, is <placeName>Weathercote</placeName> 
     Cave, a fine object, but whoever diverges for this, must return to <placeName>Ingleton</placeName>. Near <placeName>Kirkby Lonsdale</placeName> observe the view from the bridge over the <placeName>Luna</placeName>, and descend to the channel of the river, and by no means
    omit looking at <placeName>the Vale of Lune</placeName> from the Church-yard.</p>
    <p rend='indent'>The journey towards the lake country through <placeName>Lancashire</placeName>, is, with the exception of <placeName>the Vale of the Ribble</placeName>, at <placeName>Preston</placeName>, uninteresting; till you come near <placeName>Lancaster</placeName>, and
    obtain a view of the fells and mountains of <placeName>Lancashire</placeName> and <placeName>Westmorland</placeName>; with <placeName>Lancaster Castle</placeName>, and the</p>

    <p><seg type='pagenumber'>iv</seg></p>
    <p>DIRECTIONS AND INFORMATION</p>
    <p>Tower of the Church seeming to make part of the Castle, in the foreground.</p>
    <p rend='indent'>  They who wish to see the celebrated ruins of <placeName>Furness Abbey</placeName>, and are not afraid of crossing the Sands, may go from <placeName>Lancaster</placeName> to <placeName>Ulverston</placeName> ; from which place take the
     direct road to <placeName>Dalton</placeName> ; but by all means return through <placeName>Urswick</placeName>, for the sake of the view from the top of the hill, before descending into the grounds of <placeName>Conishead Priory</placeName>. From this 
     quarter the Lakes would be advantageously approached by <placeName>Coniston</placeName>; thence to <placeName>Hawkshead</placeName>, and by the Ferry over <placeName>Windermere</placeName>, to <placeName>Bowness</placeName>: a much better introduction than by going direct from
     <placeName>Coniston</placeName> to <placeName>Ambleside</placeName>, which ought not to be done, as that would greatly take off from the effect of <placeName>Windermere</placeName>.</p>
    <p rend='indent'>   Let us now go back to <placeName>Lancaster</placeName>. The direct road thence to <placeName>Kendal</placeName> is 22 miles, but by making a circuit of eight miles, <placeName>the Vale of the Lune</placeName> to <placeName>Kirkby</placeName> <placeName>Lonsdale</placeName> will be
     included. The whole tract is pleasing; there is one view mentioned by <persName>Gray</persName> and <persName>Mason</persName> especially so. In <persName>West</persName>'s Guide it is thus pointed out:â€” "About a quarter of a mile beyond the third mile-
    stone, where the road makes a turn to the right, there is a gate on the left which leads into a field where the station meant, will be found." Thus far for those who approach the Lakes from
    the South.</p>
    <p rend='indent'><roleName>Travellers</roleName> from the North would do well to go from <placeName>Carlisle</placeName> by <placeName>Wigton</placeName>, and proceed along <placeName>the lake of Bassenthwaite</placeName> to <placeName>Keswick</placeName>; or, if</p>

    <p></p>
    <p>convenience should take them first to <placeName>Penrith</placeName>, it would still be better to cross the country to <placeName>Keswick</placeName>, and begin with that vale, rather than with <placeName>Ulswater</placeName>. It is worth while to
     mention, in this place, that the banks of <placeName>the river Eden</placeName>, about <placeName>Corby</placeName>, are well worthy of notice, both on account of their natural beauty, and the viaducts which have recently been
     carried over the bed of the river, and over a neighbouring ravine. In <placeName>the Church of Wetherby</placeName>, close by, is a fine piece of monumental sculpture by <persName>Nollekins</persName>. The scenes of Nunnery,
     upon the <placeName>Eden</placeName>, or rather that part of them which is upon <placeName>Croglin</placeName>, a mountain stream there falling into the <placeName>Eden</placeName>, are, in their way, unrivalled. Bur the nearest road thither, from <placeName>Corby</placeName>,
     is so bad, that no one can be advised to take it in n carriage. Nunnery may be reached from <placeName>Corby</placeName> by making a circuit and crossing the <placeName>Eden</placeName> at <placeName>Armathwaite bridge</placeName>. A portion of this road,
     however, is bad enough.</p>
    <p rend='indent'> As much the greatest number of <roleName>Lake Tourists</roleName> begin by passing from <placeName>Kendal</placeName> to <placeName>Bowness</placeName>, upon <placeName>Windermere</placeName>, our notices shall commence with that Lake. <placeName>Bowness</placeName> is situated upon
    its eastern side, and at equal distance from each extremity of the Lake of</p>

    <p><placeName>the Coniston Mountains</placeName> peer nobly over the western barrier, which elsewhere, along the whole Lake, is comparatively tame. To one also who has ascended the hill from <placeName>Grathwaite</placeName> on the
     western side, the Promontory called <placeName>Rawlinson's Nab</placeName>, <placeName>Storr's Hall</placeName>, and <placeName>the Trout- beck Mountains</placeName>, about sunset, make a splendid landscape. The view from the Pleasure- house of the Station
     near the Ferry has suffered much from <placeName>Larch plantations</placeName>; this mischief, however, is gradually disappearing, and the Larches, under the management of the proprietor, <persName>Mr. Curwen</persName>, are giving 
     way to the native wood. <placeName>Windermere</placeName> ought to be seen both from its shores and from its surface. None of the other Lakes unfold so many fresh beauties to him who sails upon them This is 
     owing to its greater size, to the islands, and to its having two vales at the head, with their accompanying mountains of nearly equal dignity. Nor can the grandeur of these two 
     terminations be seen at once from any point, excep</p>

    <p>itself, than to have any more immediate connection with the rough mountains whence it has descended, or the turbulent torrents by which it is supplied. Many persons content themselves 
     with what they see of <placeName>Windermere</placeName> during their progress in a boat from <placeName>Bowness</placeName> to the head of the Lake, walking thence to <placeName>Ambleside</placeName>. But the whole road from <placeName>Bowness</placeName> is rich in diversity
     of pleasing or grand scenery; there is scarcely a field on the road side, which, if entered, would not give to the landscape some additional charm. Low-wood Inn, a mile from the head 
     of <placeName>Windermere</placeName>, is a most pleasant halting-place; no inn in the whole district is so agreeably situated for water views and excursions; and the fields above it, and the lane that leads 
     to <placeName>Troutbeck</placeName>, present beautiful views towards each extremity of the Lake. From this place, and from</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>AMBLESIDE,</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Rides may be taken in numerous directions, and the interesting walks are inexhaustible;* a few out of the main road may be particularized ; - the lane that leads from Ambleside to 
     <placeName>Skelgill</placeName>; the ride, or walk by <placeName>Rothay Bridge</placeName>, and up the stream under <placeName>Loughrigg Fell</placeName>, continued on the western side of <placeName>Rydal Lake</placeName>, and</p>

     From <placeName>Ambleside</placeName> is another charming excursion by <placeName>Clappersgate</placeName>, where cross the <placeName>Brathay</placeName>, and proceed with the river on the right to the hamlet of <placeName>Skehvith-fold</placeName> ; when the houses are 
     passed, turn, before you descend the hill, through a gate on the right, and from a rocky point is a fine view of the <placeName>Brathay River</placeName>, <placeName>Langdale Pikes</placeName>, &amp;c.; then proceed to Colwith- force,
     and up <placeName>Little Langdale</placeName> to <placeName>Blea Tarn</placeName>. The scene in which this small piece of water lies, suggested to <roleName>the Author</roleName> the following description, (given in his Poem of the Excursion) supposing
     the spectator to look down upon it, not from the road, but from one of its elevated sides.</p>

    <p rend='indent'>   Something of this kind, without touching upon minute details and individualities which would only confuse and embarrass, will here be attempted, in respect to the Lakes
     in <placeName>the north of England</placeName>, and the vales and mountains enclosing and surrounding them. The delineation, if tolerably executed, will, in some instances, communicate to the traveller, who has 
     already seen the objects, new information; and will assist in giving to his recollections a more orderly arrangement than his own opportunities of observing may have permitted him to
     make; while it will be still more useful to <roleName>the future traveller</roleName>, by directing his attention at once to distinctions in things which, without such previous aid, a length of time only
     could enable him to discover. It is hoped, also, that this Essay may become generally serviceable, by leading to habits of more exact and considerate observation than, as far as the 
     writer knows, have hitherto been applied to local scenery.</p>
    <p rend='indent'>   To begin, then, with the main outlines of the country; â€” I know not how to give the reader a distinct image of these more readily, than by requesting him to place himself with me,
    in imagination, upon some given point; let it be the top of either of the mountains, <placeName>Great Gavel</placeName>, or <placeName>Scawfell</placeName>; or, rather, let us suppose our station to be a cloud hanging midway between
    those two mountains, at not more than half a mile's distance from the summit of each, and not many yards above</p>

     the nave of a wheel. First, we note, lying to the south-east, <placeName>the vale of Langdale</placeName>*, which will conduct the eye to the long <placeName>lake of Winandermere</placeName>, stretched nearly to the sea; or rather to 
     tin* sands of the vast <placeName>bay of Morcamb</placeName>, serving here for the run of this imaginary wheel; - let us trace it in a direction from the south-east towards the south, and we shall next fix our
     eyes upon <placeName>the vale of Coniston</placeName>, running up likewise from the sea, but not (as all the other vallies do) to the nave of the wheel, and therefore it may he not inaptly represented as a 
     broken spoke sticking in the rim. Looking forth again, with an indination towards the west, we see immediately at our feet <placeName>the vale of Duddon</placeName>, in which is no lake, but a copious stream 
     winding among fields, rocks, and mountains, and terminating its course in the sands of <placeName>Duddon</placeName>. The fourth vale, next to be observed, viz. that of the <placeName>Esk</placeName>, is of the same general character as the last,
    yet beautifully discriminated from it by peculiar features. Its stream passes under the woody steep upon which stands <placeName>Muncaster Castle</placeName>, the ancient seat of the <persName>Penningstons</persName>,</p>

     little chapel and half a dozen neat dwellings scattered upon a plain of meadow and corn-ground intersected with stone walls apparently innumerable, like a large piece of lawless patch-work,
     or an array of mathematical figures, such as in the ancient schools of geometry might have been sportively and fantastically traced out upon sand. Beyond this little fertile plain lies, 
     within a bed of steep mountains, the long, narrow, stern, and desolate <placeName>lake of Wastdale</placeName>; and, beyond this, a dusky tract of level ground conducts the eye to <placeName>the Irish Sea</placeName>. The stream that 
     issues from <placeName>Wast-water</placeName> is named the <placeName>Irt</placeName>, and falls into the sestuary of <placeName>the river Esk</placeName>.

     began. From this it will appear, that the image of a wheel, thus far exact, is little more than one half complete; but the deficiency on the eastern side may be supplied by the vales of 
     <placeName>Wytheburn</placeName>, <placeName>Ulswater</placeName>, <placeName>Haws- water</placeName>, and <placeName>the vale of Grasmere</placeName> and <placeName>Rydal</placeName>; none of these, however, run up to the central point between <placeName>Great Gavel</placeName> and <placeName>Scawfell</placeName>. From this, hitherto our central
     point, take a flight of not more than four or five miles eastward to <placeName>the ridge of Helvellyn</placeName>, and you will look down upon <placeName>Wytheburn</placeName> and <placeName>St. John's Vale</placeName>, which are a branch of <placeName>the vale of
     Keswick</placeName> ; upon <placeName>Ulswater</placeName>, stretching due east:- and not far beyond to the south-east (though from this point not visible) lie the vale and lake of <placeName>Hawswater</placeName>; and lastly, <placeName>the vale of

    <p>forms and surfaces, first of the swelling grounds, next of the hills and rocks, and lastly of the mountains - an ascent of almost regular gradation, from elegance and richness, to their
     highest point of grandeur and sublimity. It follows therefore from this, first, that these rocks, hills, and mountains, must present themselves to view in stages rising above each other,
     the mountains clustering together towards the central point; and next, that an observer familiar with the several vales, must, from their various position in relation to the sun, have had
     before his eyes every possible embellishment of beauty, dignity, and splendour, which light and shadow can bestow upon objects so diversified. For example, in <placeName>the vale of Winandermere</placeName>, if 
     <roleName>the spectator</roleName> looks for gentle and lovely scenes, his eye is turned towards the south; if for the grand, towards the north: in <placeName>the vale of Keswick</placeName>, which (as hath been said) lies almost 
     due north of this, it is directly the reverse. Hence, when the sun is setting in summer far to the north-west, it is seen, by <roleName>the spectator</roleName> from the shores or breast of <placeName>Winandermere</placeName>, resting among the
    summits of the loftiest mountains, some of which will perhaps be half or wholly hidden by clouds, or by teh blaze of light which the orb diffuses around it; and the surface of the lake will 
    reflect before the eye correspondent colours through every variety of beauty, and through all degrees of speldour. In <placeName>the vale of Keswick</placeName>, at the same period, the sun sets</p>

    <p>over the humbler regions of the landscape, and showers down upon <emph>them</emph> the radiance which at once veils and glorifies, - sending forth, meanwhile, broad streams of rosy, 
     crimson, purple, or golden light, towards the grand mountains in the south and south-east, which, thus illuminated, with all their projections and cavities, and with an intermixture of
     solemn shadows, are seen distinctly through a cool and clear atmosphere. Of course, there is as marked a difference between the <emph>noontide</emph> appearance of these two opposite
     vales. The bedimming haze that overspreads the south, and the clear atmosphere and determined shadows of the clouds in the north, at the same time of the day, are each seen in these 
     several vales, with a contrast as striking. <roleName>The reader</roleName> will easily conceive in what degree the intermediate vales partake of a kindred variety.</p>
    <p rend='indent'>   I do not indeed know any tract of country in which, within so narrow a compass, may be found an equal variety in the influences of light and shadow upon the sublime or beautiful 
    features of landscape; and it is owing to the combined circumstances to which the reader's attention has been directed. From a point between <placeName>Great Gavel</placeName> and <placeName>Scawfell</placeName>, a <roleName>shepherd</roleName> would not require more
    than an hour to descend into any one of eight of the principal vales by which he would be surrounded; and all the others lie (with the exception of <placeName>Hawswater</placeName>) at but a small distance. Yet, 
    though clustered together, every valley has its distinct</p>

    <p>and separate character: in some instances, as if they had been formed in studied contrast to each other, and in others with the united pleasing differences and resemblances of a
     sisterly rivalship. This concentration of interest gives to the country a decided superiority over the most attractive districts of <placeName>Scotland</placeName> and <placeName>Wales</placeName>, especially for <roleName>the pedestrian</roleName> 
     traveller. In <placeName>Scotland</placeName> and <placeName>Wales</placeName> are found, undoubtedly, individual scenes, which, in their several kinds, cannot be excelled. But, in <placeName>Scotland</placeName>, particularly, what long tracts of 
     desolate country intervene! so that the traveller, when he reaches a spot deservedly of great celebrity, would find it difficult to determine how much of his pleasure is owing to 
     excellence inherent in the landscape itself; and how much to an instantaneous recovery from an oppression left upon his spirits by the barrenness and desolation through which he has
     passed.</p>
    <p rend='indent'>   But to proceed with our survey; - and, first, of the MOUNTAINS. Their <emph>forms</emph> are endlessly diversied, sweeping easily or boldly in simple majesty, abrupt and
    precipitous, or soft and elegant. In magnitude and grandeur they are individually inferior to the most celebrated of those in some other parts of this island; but, in the combinations which they make,
    towering above each other, or lifting themselves in ridges like the waves of a tumultuous sea, and in the beauty and variety of their surfaces and colours, they are surpassed by none.</p>
    <p rend='indent'>The general <emph>surface</emph> of the mountains is turf,</p>

    <p>MOUNTAINS.</p>
    <p><seg type='pagenumber'>9</seg></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>rendered rich and green by the moisture of the climate. Sometimes the turf, as in the neighbourhood of <placeName>Newlands</placeName>, is little broken, the whole covering being soft and downy pasturage. In 
     other places rocks predominate; the soil is laid bare, by torrents and burstings of water from the sides of the mountains in heavy rains; and not unfrequently their perpendicular sides 
     are seamed by ravines (formed also by rains and torrents) which, meeting in angular points, entrench and scar the surface with numerous figures like the letters W. and Y.</p>
    <p rend='indent'>   In the ridge that divides <placeName>Eskdale</placeName> from <placeName>Wasdale</placeName>, granite is found; but the MOUNTAINS are for the most part composed of the stone by <roleName>mineralogists</roleName> termed schist, which, as
     you approach the plain country, gives place to limestone and free-stone; but schist being the substance of the mountains, the predominant colour of their rocky parts is bluish, or hoary 
     grey - the general tint of the lichens with which the bare stone is encrusted. With this blue or grey colour is frequently intermixed a red tinge, proceeding from the iron that interveins the
    stone, and impregnates the soil. The iron is the principle of decomposition in these rocks; and hence, when they become pulverized, the elementary partiles crumbling down, overspread
    in many places the steep and almost precipitous sides of the mountains with an intermixture of colours, like the compound hues of a dove's neck. When in the heat of advancing summer,

    <p>tint of the herbage has somewhat faded, it is again revived by the appearance of the fern profusely spread over the same ground: and, upon this plant, more than upon anything else, do 
     the changes which the seasons make in the colouring of the mountains depend. About <date>the first week in October</date>, the rich green, which prevailed through the whole summer, is usually passed
     away. The brilliant and various colours of the fern are then in harmony with the autumnal woods; bright yellow or lemon colour, at the base of the mountains, melting gradually, through
     orange, to a dark russet brown towards the summits, where the plant, being more exposed to the weather, is in a more advanced state of decay. Neither heath nor furze are <emph>generally</emph> found
     upon the <emph>sides</emph> of these mountains, though in many places they are adorned by those plants, so beautiful when in flower. We may add, that the mountains are of height sufficient to have the
     surface towards the summit softened by distance, and to imbibe the finest aerial hues. In common also with other mountains, their apparent forms and colours are perpetually changed by the
     clouds and vapours which float round them: the effect indeed of mist or haze, in a country of this character, is like that of magic. I have seen six or seven ridges rising above each other,
     all created in a moment by the vapours upon the side of a mountain, which, in its ordinary appearance, shewed not a projecting point to furnish even a hint for such an operation.</p>

    <p></p>
    <p rend='indent'>   I will take this opportunity of observing, that they who have studied the appearances of nature feel that the superiority, in point of visual interest, of mountainous 
     over other countries - is more strikingly displayed in winter than in summer. This, as must be obvious, is partly owing to the forms of the mountains, which, of course, are not affected
     by the seasons; but also, in no small degree, to the greater variety that exists in their winter than their summer colouring. This variety is such, and so harmoniously preserved, that it
     leaves little cause of regret when the splendour of autumn is passed away. The oak-coppices, upon the sides of the mountains, retain russet leaves; the birch stands conspicuous with its 
     silver stem and puce-coloured twigs; the hollies, with green leaves and scarlet berries, have come forth to view from among the deciduous trees, whose summer foliage had concealed them:
     the ivy is now plentifully apparent upon the stems and boughs o</p>

    <p>WINTER COLOURING.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>   productions of nature, to which winter is rather favourable than unkindly, scattered over 
     the walls, banks of earth, rocks, and stones, and upon the trunks of trees, with the intermixture of several species of small fern, now green and fresh ; and, to the observing 
     passenger, their forms and colours are a source of inexhaustable admiration. Add to this the hoar-frost and snow, with all the varieties they create, and which volumes would not be 
     sufficient to describe. I will content myself with one instance of the colouring produced by snow, which may not be uninteresting to painters. It is extracted from the memorandum-book 
     of a friend; and for its accuracy I can speak, having been an eye-witness of the appearance. &quot;I observed,&quot; says he, &quot; the beautiful effect of the drifted snow upon the 
     mountains, and the perfect <emph>tone</emph> of colour. From the top of the mountains downwards a rich olive was produced by the powdery snow and the grass, which olive was warmed with
     a little brown, and in this way harmoniously combined, by insensible gradations, with the white.  The drifting took away the monotony of snow; and the whole <placeName>vale
    of Grasmere</placeName>, seen from the terrace walk in <placeName>Easedale</placeName>, was as varied, perhaps more so, than even in the pomp of autumn. In the distane was <placeName>Loughrigg-Fell</placeName>, the basin-wall of
    the lake: this, from the summit downward, was a rich orange-olive; then the lake of a bright olive-green, nearly the same tint as the snow-powdered mountain.</p>

    <p></p>
    <p>tops and high slopes in <placeName>Easedale</placeName> ; and lastly, the church, with its firs, forming the centre of the view. Next to the church came nine distinguishable hills, six of them with woody
     sides turned towards us, all of them oak-copses with their bright red leaves and snow-powdered twigs; these hills - so variously situated in relation to each other, and to the view in
     general, so variously powdered, some only enough to give the herbage a rich brown tint, one intensely white and lighting up all the others - were vet so placed, as in the most 
     inobtrusive manner to harmonise by contrast with a perfect naked, snowless bleak summit in the far distance.&quot;</p>
    <p rend='indent'>   Having spoken of the forms, surface, and colour of the mountains, let us descend into the VALES. Though these have been represented under the general image of the 
     spokes of a wheel, they are, for the most part, winding; the windings of many being abrupt and intricate. And, it may be observed, that, in one circumstance, the general shape of them
     all has been determined by that primitive conformation through which so many became receptacles of lakes. For they are not formed, as are most of the celebrated Welsh vallies, by an 
     approximation of the sloping bases of the opposite mountains towards each other, leaving little more between than a channel for the passage of a hasty river; but the bottom of of these 
     vallies is mostly a spacious and gently declining area, apparently level as the floor</p>

    <p>Vales.</p>

    <p>of a temple, or the surface of a lake, and broken in many cases, by rocks and hills, which rise up like islands from the plain. In such of <placeName>the Tallies</placeName> as make many windings, these 
     level areas open upon <roleName>the traveller</roleName> in succession, divided from each- other sometimes by a mutual approximation of the hills, leaving only passage for a river, sometimes by
     correspondent windings, without such approximation; and sometimes by a bold advance, of one mountain towards that which is opposite it. It may here be observed with propriety that 
     the several rocks and hills, which have been described as rising up like islands from the level area of the vale, have regulated the choice of the inhabitants in the situation of their
     dwellings. Where none of these are found, and the inclination of the ground is not sufficiently rapid easily to carry off the waters, (as in the higher part of <placeName>Langdale</placeName>, for instance,)
     the houses are not sprinkled over the middle of the vales, but confined to their sides, being placed merely so far up the mountain as to be protected from the floods. But where these
     rocks and hills have been scattered over the plain of the vale, (as in <placeName>Grasmere</placeName>, <placeName>Donnerdale</placeName>, <placeName>Eskdale</placeName>, &amp;c.) the beauty which they give to the scene is much heightened by a single 
     cottage, or cluster of cottages, that will be almost always found under them, or upon their sides; dryness and shelter having tempted <roleName>the Dalesmen</roleName> to fix their habitations there.</p>

    <p rend='indent'>   I shall now speak of the LAKES of this country. The form of the lake is most perfect when, like <placeName>Derwent-water</placeName>, and some of the smaller lakes, it least resembles that 
     of a river; - I mean, when being looked at from any given point where the whole may be seen at once, the width of it bears such proportion to the length, that, however the outline may
     be diversified by far -receding bays, it never assumes the shape of a river, and is contemplated with that placid and quiet feeling which belongs peculiarly to the lake- as a body of 
     still water under the influence of no current; reflecting therefore the clouds, the light, and all the imagery of the sky and surrounding hills; expressing also and making visible the
     changes of the atmosphere, and motions of the lightest breeze, and subject to agitation only from the winds-</p>

    <p>It must be noticed, as a favourable characteristic of the lakes of this country, that, though several of the largest, such as <placeName>Winandermere</placeName>, <placeName>Ulswater</placeName>, <placeName>Hawswater</placeName>, do, when the whole length 
    of them is commanded from an elevated point, loose somewhat of the peculiar form of the lake, and assume the resemblance of a magnificent river; yet, as their shape is winding,</p>

    <p>(particularly that of <placeName>Ulswater</placeName> and <placeName>Hawswater</placeName>) when the view of the whole is obstructed by those barriers which determine the windings, and the spectator is confined to one reach, the 
     appropriate feeling is revived; and one lake may thus in succession present to the eye the essential characteristic of many. But, though the forms of the large lakes have this 
     advantage, it is nevertheless favourable to the beauty of the country that the largest of them are comparatively small; and that the same vale generally furnishes a succession of
     lakes, instead of being filled with one. The vales in <placeName>North Wales</placeName>, as hath been observed, are not formed for the reception of lakes; those of <placeName>Switzerland</placeName>, <placeName>Scotland</placeName>, and this part 
     of <placeName>the North of England</placeName>, <emph>are</emph> so formed; but, in <placeName>Switzerland</placeName> and <placeName>Scotland</placeName>, the proportion of diffused water is often too great, as at <placeName>the lake of Geneva</placeName> for instance, and in most of
     <placeName>the Scotch lakes</placeName>. No doubt it sounds magnificent and flatters the imagination, to hear at a distance of expanses of water so many leagues in length and miles in width; and such ample
     room may be delightful to <roleName>the fresh-water sailor</roleName>, scudding with a lively breeze amid the rapidly-shifting scenery. But, who ever travelled along the banks of <placeName>Loch-Lomond</placeName>, variegated as

    <p>stream to run by his side? In fact, a notion, of grandeur, as connected with magnitude, has seduced persons of taste into a general mistake upon this subject. It is much more 
     desirable, for the purposes of pleasure, that lakes should be numerous, and small or middle- sized, than large, not only for communication by walks and rides, but for variety, and for
     recurrence of similar appearances. To illustrate this by one instance: - how pleasing is it to have a ready and frequent opportunity of watching, at the outlet of a lake, the stream
     pushing its way among the rocks in lively contrast with the stillness from which it has escaped; and how amusing to compare its noisy and turbulent motions with the gentle playfulness 
     of the breezes, that may be starting up or wandering here and thereover the faintly-rippled surface of the broad water! I may add, as a general remark, that, in lakes of great width, 
     the shores cannot be distinctly seen at the same time, and therefore contribute little to mutual illustration and ornament; and, if the opposite shores are out of sight of 
    each other, like those of the <placeName>American</placeName> and <placeName>Asiatic lakes</placeName>, then unfortunately <roleName>the traveller</roleName> is reminded of a nobler object; he has the blankness of a sea-prospect without the grandeur and accompanying
    sense of power.</p>

     broken by the <emph>secondary</emph> agents of nature, ever at work to supply the <emph>deficiences</emph> of the mould in which things were originally cast. Using the word deficiences, I do not speak with
     reference to those stronger emotions which a region of mountains is peculiarly fitted to excite. The bases of those huge barriers may run for a long space in straight lines, and these
     parallel to each other; the opposite sides of a profound vale may ascend as exact counterparts, or in mutual reflection, like the billows of a troubled sea; and the impression be, from 
     its very simplicity, more awful and sublime. Sublimity is the result of Nature's first great dealings with the superficies of the earth; but the general tendency of her subsequent 
     operations is towards the production of beauty; by a multiplicity of symmetrical parts uniting in a consistent whole. This is every where exemplified along the margins of these lakes. Masses of rock,
    that have been preciptated from the heights into the area of waters, lie in some places like stranded ships; or have acquired the compact structure of jutting piers; or project in little 
    peninsulas crested with native wood. The smallest rivulet â€” one whose silent influx is scarcely noticeable in a season of dry weather so faint is the dimple made by
    it on the surface of the smooth lake â€” will</p>

     encroaching upon the level of the lake, have, in course of time, given birth to ample promontories of sweeping outline that contrasts boldly with the longitudinal base of the steeps
     on the opposite shore; while their flat or gently- sloping surfaces never fail to introduce, into the midst of desolation and barrenness, the elements of fertility, even where the 
     habitations of men may not have been raised. These alluvial promontories, however, threaten, in some places, to bisect the waters which they have long adorned; and, in course of ages,
     they will cause some of the lakes to dwindle into numerous and insignificant pools; which, in their turn, will finally be filled up. But, checking these intrusive calculations, let us
     rather be content with appearances as they are, and pursue in imagination the meandering shores, whether rugged steeps, admitting of no cultivation, descend into the water; or
     gently-sloping lawns and woods, or flat and fertile meadows stretch between the margin of the lake and the mountains. Among minuter recommendations will be noticed, especially
     along bays exposed to the setting-in of strong-winds, the curved rim of fine blue gravel, thrown up in course of time by the waves, half of it perhaps gleaming from under the water,
     and the corresponding half of a lighter</p>

     descried with folded wings, that might seem to have caught their delicate hue from the blue waters, by the side of which she watches for her sustenance. In winter, the lakes are 
     sometimes resorted to by wild swans; and in that season habitually by widgeons, goldings, and other aquatic fowl of the smaller species. Let me be allowed the aid of verse to describe

    <p rend='indent'>   This part of the subject may be concluded with observing - that, from the multitude of brooks and torrents that fall into these lakes, and of internal springs by
     which they are fed, and which circulate through them like veins, they are truly living lakes, &quot;<emph>vivi lacus</emph>;&quot; and are thus discriminated from the stagnant and sullen pools
     frequent among mountains that have been formed by volcanoes, and from the shallow meres found in flat and fenny countries. The water is also of crystalline purity; so that, if it
     were not for the reflections of the incumbent mountains by which it is darkened, a delusion might be felt, by a person resting quietly in a boat on the bosom of <placeName>Winandermere</placeName> or
     <placeName>Derwent-water</placeName>, similar to that which <persName>Carver</persName> so beautifully describes when he was floating alone in the middle of <placeName>lake Erie</placeName> or <placeName>Ontario</placeName>, and could almost have imagined that his boat was
     suspended in an element as pure as air, or rather that the air and water were one.</p>
    <p rend='indent'>   Having spoken of Lakes I must not omit to mention, as a kindred feature of this countyr, those bodies of still water called TARNS. In the economy of nature these are useful,
    as auxiliars to Lakes; for if the whole quantity of water which falls upon the mountains in time of storm were poured down upon the plains without intervention in some quarters,
    of such receptacles, the habitable grounds would be much more subject than they are to inundation. But, as some of the collateral</p>

    <p></p>
    <p>brooks spend their fury, finding a free course toward and also down the channel of the main stream of the vale before those that have to pass through the higher tarns and lakes have 
     tilled their several basins, a gradual distribution is effected ; and the waters thus reserved, instead of uniting, to spread ravage and deformity, with those which meet with no such 
     detention, contribute to support, for a length of time, the vigour of many streams without a fresh fall of rain. Tarns are found in some of the vales, and are numerous upon the mountains.
     A Tarn, in a Vale, implies, for the most part, that the bed of the vale is not happily formed; that the water of the brooks can neither wholly escape, nor diffuse itself over a large area.
     Accordingly, in such situations, Tarns are often surrounded by an unsightly tract of boggy ground; but this is not always the case, and in the cultivated parts of the country, when the
     shores of the Tarn are determined, it differs only from the Lake in being smaller, and in belonging mostly to a smaller valley, or circular recess. Of this class of miniature lakes,
     <placeName>Loughrigg Tarn</placeName>, near <placeName>Grasmere</placeName>, is the most beautiful example. It has a margin of green firm meadows, of rocks, and rocky woods, a few reeds here, a little company of water-lilies there,
     with beds of gravel or stone beyond; a tiny stream issuing neither briskly nor sluggishly out of it; but its feeding rills, from the shortness of their course, so small as to be scarcely 
     visible. Five</p>

     who has time to spare. They are difficult of access and naked; yet some of them are, in their permanent forms, very grand; and there are accidents of things which would make the meanest 
     of them interesting. At all events, one of these pools is an acceptable sight to the mountain wanderer; not merely as an incident that diversifies the prospect, but as forming in his mind
     a centre or conspicuous point to which objects, otherwise disconnected or insubordinated, may be referred. Some few have a varied outline, with bold heath-clad promontories; and, as they 
     mostly lie at the foot of a steep precipice, the water where the sun is not shining upon it, appears black and sullen; and, round the margin, huge stones and masses of rock are scattered;
    some defying conjecture as to the means by which they came thither; and others obviously fallen from on high â€” the contribution of ages! A not unpleasing sadness is induced

     rather large brooks than rivers. The water is perfectly pellucid, through which in many places are seen, to a great depth, their beds of rock, or of blue gravel, which give to the water

    <p rend='indent'>   The WOODS consist chiefly of oak, ash, and birch, and here and there Wych-elm, with underwood of hazle, the white and black thorn, and hollies; in moist places alders

     the plough of the first settlers having followed naturally the veins of richer, dryer, or less stony soil; and thus it has shaped out an intermixture of wood and lawn, with a grace and
     wildness which it would have been impossible for the hand of studied art to produce. Other trees have been introduced within these last <date>fifty years</date>, such as beeches, larches, limes,
     &amp;c. and plantations of firs, seldom with advantage, and often with great injury to the appearance of the country; but the sycamore (which I believe was brought into this island

     frost, under a canopy of leaden and shapeless clouds, is, as far as it allows things to be seen, equally disagreeable.</p>
    <p rend='indent'>   It has been said that in human life there are moments worth ages. In a more subdued tone of sympathy may we affirm, that in the climate of <placeName>England</placeName> there are, for the lover of nature,
    days which are worth whole months â€” I might say â€” even years. One of these favoured days sometimes occurs in spring-time, when that soft air is breathing over the blossoms and new-born verdure, which
    inspired <persName>Buchanan</persName> with his beautiful Ode to <date>the first of May</date>; the air, which in the luxuriance of his fancy, he likens to that of the golden age, â€” to that which gives motion to the funeral
    cypresses on the banks of <placeName>Lethe</placeName>;â€” to the air</p>

    <p>which is to salute beatified spirits when expiatory fires shall have consumed the earth with all her habitations. But it is in autumn that days of such affecting influence most
     frequently intervene; - the atmosphere seems refined, and the sky rendered more crystalline, as the vivifying heat of the year abates; the lights and shadows are more delicate; the 
     coloring is richer and more finely harmonized; and, in this season of stillness, the ear being unoccupied, or only gently excited, the sense of vision becomes more susceptible of its 
     appropriate enjoyments. A resident in a country like this which we are treating of, will agree with me, that the presence of a lake is indispensable to exhibit in perfection the beauty
     of one of these days; and he must have experienced, while looking on the unruffled waters, that the imagination, by their aid, is carried into recesses of feeling otherwise impenetrable.
     The reason of this is, that the heavens are not only brought down into the bosom of the earth, but that the earth is mainly looked at, and thought of, through the medium of a purer element.
    The happiest times is when the equinoxial gales are departed; but their fury may probably be called to mind by the sight of a few shattered boughs, whose leaves do not differ in colour
    from the faded foliage of the stately oaks from which these relics of the storm depend: all else speaks of tranquility; â€” not a breath of air, no restlessness of insects, and not a moving
    object perceptible â€”</p>

    <p>exeept the clouds gliding in the depths of the lake, or the traveller passing along, an inverted image, whose motion seems governed by the quiet of a time, to which its archetype, the
     living person, is, perhaps, insensible: - or it may happen, that the figure of one of the larger birds, a raven or a heron, is crossing silently among the reflected clouds, while the voice
     of the real bird, from the element aloft, gently awakens in the spectator the recollection of appetites and instincts, pursuits and occupations, that deform and agitate the world, - yet

     these scenes from a changeable atmosphere, would apply, perhaps still more forcibly, to their appearance under the varied solemnities of night. <persName>Milton</persName>, it will be remembered, has given a
     clouded moon to Paradise itself. In the night-season also, the narrowness of the vales, and comparative smallness of the lakes, are especially adapted to bring surrounding objects home to
     the eye and to the heart. The stars, taking their stations above the hill-tops, are contemplated from a spot like the <trait type="ethnicity"><label>Abyssinian</label></trait> recess of <persName>Rasselas</persName>, with much more touching inter-</p>

    <p>est than they are likely to excite when looked at from an open country with ordinary undulations: and it must be obvious, that it is the buys only of large lakes that can present such 
     contrasts of light and shadow as those of smaller dimensions display from every quarter. A deep contracted valley, with diffused waters, such a valley and plains level and wide as those
     of <placeName>Chaldea</placeName>, are the two extremes in which the beauty of the heavens and their connexion with the earth are most sensibly felt. Nor do the advantages I have been speaking of imply here an
     exclusion of the aerial effects of distance. These are insured by the height of the mountains, and are found, even in the narrowest vales, where they lengthen in perspective, or act (if
     the expression may be used) as telescopes for the open country.</p>

     waters. He may see or hear in fancy the winds sweeping over the lakes, or piping with a loud voice among the mountain peaks; and, lastly, may think of the primeval woods shedding and
     renewing their leaves with no human eye to notice, or human heart to regret or welcome the change. &quot;When the first settlers entered this region (says an animated writer) they found 
     it overspread with wood; forest trees, the fir, the oak, the ash, and the birch had skirted the fells, tufted the hills, and shaded the vallies, through centuries of silent solitude; the
     birds and beasts of prey reigned over the meeker species; and the <emph>belium inter omnia</emph> maintained the balance of nature in the empire of beasts.&quot;</p>

     attraction for the high-born and powerful; especially as the more open parts of the country furnished positions for castles and houses of defence, sufficient to repel any of those
     sudden attacks, which, in the then rude state of military knowledge, could be made upon them. Accordingly, the more retired regions (and to such I am now confining myself) must have
     been neglected or shunned even by the persons whose baronial or signioral rights extended over them, and left, doubtless, partly as a place of refuge for outlaws and robbers, and
     partly granted out for the more settled habitation of a few vassals following the employment of shepherds or woodlanders. Hence these lakes and inner vallies are unadorned by any 
     remains of ancient grandeur, castles, or monastic edifices, which are only found upon the skirts of the country, as <placeName>Furness Abbey</placeName>, <placeName>Calder Abbey</placeName>, <placeName>the Priory of Lannercost</placeName>, <placeName>Gleaston Castle</placeName>, â€”

     consequences have affected the face of the country materially to the present day, being, in fact, one of the principal causes which give it such a striking superiority, in beauty and

    <p rend='indent'>   &quot; When <roleName>the Abbots of Furness</roleName>,&quot; says an <roleName>author</roleName> before cited, &quot; enfranchised their villains, and raised them to the dignity of customary <roleName>tenants</roleName>, the lands,
     which they had cultivated for their <roleName>lord</roleName>, were divided into whole tenements; each of which, besides the customary annual rent, was charged with the obligation of having in readiness a man 
     completely armed for <roleName>the king</roleName>'s service on the borders, or elsewhere; each of these whole tenements was again subdivided into four equal parts; each villain had one; and <roleName>the party tenant</roleName> 
     contributed his share to the support of <roleName>the man of arms</roleName>, and of other burdens. These divisions were not properly distinguished; the land remained mixed; each tenant had a share through all 
     the arable and meadow-land, and common of pasture over all the wastes. These sub-tenements were judged sufficient for the support of so many families; and no further division was permitted.
     These divisions and and sub-divisions were convenient at the time for which they were calculated: the land, so</p>

     <placeName>Furness</placeName> was considered, was in a constant state of attack and defence; more hands, therefore, were necessary to guard the coast, to repel an invasion from <placeName>Scotland</placeName>, or make reprisals
     on <roleName>the hostile neighbour</roleName>. The dividing the lands in such manner as has been shown, increased the number of inhabitants, and kept them at home till called for : and, the land being mixed, 
     and the several <roleName>tenants</roleName> united in equipping the plough, the absence of the fourth man was no prejudice to the cultivation of his land, which was committed.to the care of three.</p>
    <p rend='indent'>   &quot;While the villains of <placeName>Low Furness</placeName> were thus distributed over the land, and employed in agriculture; those of <placeName>High Furness</placeName> were charged with the care of flocks and

     in <placeName>High Furness</placeName> ; and holly-trees were carefully preserved for that purpose when all other wood was cleared off; large tracts of common being so covered with these trees, as to have the 
     appearance of a forest of hollies. At <roleName>the Shepherd</roleName>'s call, the flocks surrounded the holly- bush. and received the croppings at his hand, which they greedily nibbled up, bleating for</p>

    <p>several portions being marked out by stones, hushes, or trees: which portions, where the custom has survived, to this day are called <emph>dales</emph>, from the word <emph>deylen</emph>, to distribute; but,
     while the valley was thus lying open, enclosures seem to have taken place upon the sides of the mountains; because the land there was not intermixed, and was of little comparative value;
     and, therefore, small opposition would lit: made to its being appropriated by those to- whose habitations it was contiguous. Hence the singular appearance which the sides of many of these
     mountains exhibit, intersected, as they are, almost to the summit, with stone walls. When first erected, these stone fences must have little disfigured the face of the country; as part of
     the lines would every where be hidden by the quantity of native wood then remaining; and the lines would also be broken (as they still are) by the rocks which interrupt and vary their 
     course. In the meadows, and in those parts of the lower grounds where the soil has not been sufficiently drained, and could not afford a stable foundation, there, when the increasing 
     value of land, and the inconvenience suffered from intermixed plots of ground in common field, had induced each inhabitant to enclose his own, they were compelled to make the fences of
     alders, willows, and other trees. These, where the native wood had disappeared, have frequently enriched the vallies with a sylvan appearance; while the intricate intermixture of property
     has given</p>

    <p>to the fences a graceful irregularity, which, where large properties are prevalent, and large capitals employed in agriculture, is unknown. This sylvan appearance is heightened by the
     the number of ash-trees planted in rows along the quick fences, and along the walls, for the purpose of browzing the cattle at the approach of winter. The branches are lopped off and 
     strewn upon the pastures; and when the cattle have stripped them of the leaves, they are used for repairing the hedges or for fuel.</p>
    <p rend='indent'>We have thus seen a numerous body of <roleName>Dalesmen</roleName> creeping into posession of their home-steads, their little crofts, their mountain-enclosures; and. finally, the whole vale
     is visibly divided; except, perhaps, here and there some marshy ground, which, till fully drained, would not repay the trouble of enclosing. But these last partitions do not seem to have
     been general, till long after the pacification of the Borders, by the union of the two crowns: when the cause, which had first determined the distribution of land into such small parcels, had not
    only ceased, â€” but likewise a general improvement had taken place in the country, with a correspondent rise in the value of its produce. From the time of the union, it is certain that this
    species of feudal population must rapidly have diminished. That it was formerly much more numerous than it is at present, is evident from the multitude of tenements (I do not mean houses, but

     him to the wars.&quot; But, as I have said, from the union of the two crowns, this numerous vassalage (their services not being wanted) would rapidly diminish; various tenements would be
     united in one possessor; and the aboriginal houses, probably little better than hovels, like the kraels of savages, or the huts of <trait type="ethnicity"><label>the Highlanders of Scotland</label></trait>, would fall into decay, and 
     the places of many be supplied by substantial and comfortable buildings, a majority of which remain to this day scattered over the vallies, and are often the only dwellings found in them.</p>
    <p rend='indent'>From the time of the erection of these houses, till within the last sixty years, the state of society, though no doubt slowly and gradually improving, underwent no material
    change. Corn was grown in these vales (through which no carriage-road had yet been made) sufficient upon each estate to furnish bread for each family, and no more: notwithstanding the union
    of several tenements, the possessions of each</p>

    <p>inhabitant still being small, in the same field was seen an intermixture of different crops; and the plough was interrupted by little rocks, mostly overgrown with wood, or by spongy 
     places, which <roleName>the tillers of the soil</roleName> had neither leisure nor capital to convert into firm land. The storms and moisture of the climate induced them to sprinkle their upland property with 
     outhouses of native stone, as places of shelter for their sheep, where, in tempestuous weather, food was distributed to them. Every family spun from its own flock the wool with which it 
     was clothed; a <roleName>weaver</roleName> was here and there found among them; and the rest of their wants was supplied by the produce of the yarn, which they carded and spun in their own houses, and carried 
     to market, either under their arms, or more frequently on pack-horses, a small train taking their way weekly down the valley or over the mountains to the most commodious town. They had, as 
     I have said, their rural chapel, and of course their <roleName>minister</roleName>, in clothing or in manner of life, in no respect differing from themselves, except on the Sabbath-day; this was the sole 
     distinguished individual among them; every thing else, person and possession, exhibited a perfect equality, a community of <roleName>shepherds</roleName> and <roleName>agriculturists</roleName>, <placeName>proprietors</placeName>, for the most part, of
     the lands which they occupied and cultivated.</p>

    <p>the sustenance of the flocks in winter, - such was then the rude state of agriculture; and, for the same cause, it was necessary that care should be taken of some part of the growth of
     the native woods. Accordingly, in <persName>Queen Elizabeth</persName>'s time, this was so strongly felt, that a petition was made to the Crown, praying, &quot;That the Blomaries in <placeName>High Furness</placeName> might be 
     abolished, on account of the quantity of wood which was consumed in them for the use of the mines, to the great detriment of the cattle.&quot; But this same cause, about a hundred years
     after, produced effects directly contrary to those which had been deprecated. The re-establishment, at that period, of furnaces upon a large scale, made it the interest of the people to 
     convert the steeper and more stony of the enclosures, sprinkled over with remains of the native forest, into dose woods, which, when cattle and sheep were excluded, rapidly sowed and 
     thickened themselves. The reader's attention has been directed to the cause by which tufts of wood, pasturage, meadow, and arable land, with its various produce, are intricately intermingled
    in the same field; and he will now see, in like manner, how enclosures entirely of wood, and those of cultivated ground, are blended all over the country under a law of similar wildness.</p>

     humble dwellings remind the contemplative sped at or of a production of nature, and may (using a strong expression) rather he said to have (frown than to have been erected; - to have
     risen, by an instinct of their own, out of the native rock - so little is there in them of formality, such is their wildness and beauty. Among the numerous recesses and projections in
     the walls and in the different stages of their roofs, are seen bold and harmonious effects of contrasted sunshine and shadow. It is a favourable circumstance, that the strong winds,
     which sweep down the vallies, induced the inhabitants, at a time when the materials for building were easily procured, to furnish many of these dwellings with substantial porches; 
     and such as have not this defence, are seldom unprovided with a projection of two large slates over their thresholds. Nor will the singular beauty of the chimneys escape the eye of the attentive
    traveller. Sometimes a low chimney, almost upon a level with the roof, is overlaid with a slate, supported upon four slender pillars, to prevent the wind from driving the smoke down the chimney.
    Others are of a quadrangular shape, rising one or two feet above the roof; which low square is often surmounted by a tall cylinder, giving to the cottage chimney the most beautiful shape in</p>

    <p>which it is ever seen. Nor will it be too fanciful or refined to remark, that there is a pleasing harmony between a tall chimney of this circular form, and the living column of smoke, 
     ascending from it through the still air. These dwellings, mostly built, as has been said, of rough unhewn stone, are roofed with slates, which were rudely taken from the quarry before the 
     present art of splitting them was understood, and are, therefore, rough and uneven in their surface, so that both the coverings and sides of the houses have furnished places of rest for
     the seeds of lichens, mosses, ferns, and flowers. Hence buildings, which in their very form call to mind the processes of nature, do thus, clothed in part with a vegetable garb, appear to 
     be received into the bosom of the living principle of things, as it acts and exists among the woods and fields; and, by their colour and their shape, affectingly direct the thoughts to 
     that tranquil course of nature and simplicity, along which the humble-minded inhabitants have, through so many generations, been led. Add the little garden with its shed for bee-hives,
     its small bed of pot-herbs, and its borders and patches of flowers for Sunday posies, with sometimes a choice few too much prized to be plucked; an orchard of proportioned size; a cheese-
     press, often supported by some tree near the door; a cluster of embowering sycamores for summer shade; with a tall fir, through which the winds sing when other trees are leafless;</p>

    <p rend='indent'>   Till within the last sixty years there was no communication between any of these vales by carriage-roads; all bulky articles were transported on pack-horses. Owing,
     however, to the population not being concentrated in villages, hut scattered, the vallies themselves were intersected as now by innumerable lanes and path-ways leading from house to
     house and from field to field. These lanes, where they are fenced by stone walls, are mostly bordered with ashes, hazels, wild roses, and beds of tall fern, at their base; while the
     walls themselves, if old, tire overspread with mosses, small ferns, wild strawberries, the geranium, and lichens: and, if the wall happen to rest against a bank of earth, it is
     sometimes almost wholly concealed by a rich facing of stone-fern. It is a great advantage to a <roleName>traveller</roleName> or <roleName>resident</roleName>, that these numerous lanes and paths, if he be a zealous admirer of nature,

     rudeness, I must at the same time add, that many of these structures are in themselves models of elegance, as if they had been formed upon principles of the most thoughtful architecture. 
     It is to be regretted that these monuments of the skill of our ancestors, and of that happy instinct by which consummate beauty was produced, are disappearing fast; but sufficient
     specimens remain* to give a high gratification to the man of genuine taste. <roleName>Travellers</roleName> who may not have been accustomed to pay attention to things so inobtrusive, will excuse me if I point

     we chiefly owe whatever ornament is still left to the country of majestic timber. Through the open parts of the vales are scattered, also, houses of a middle rank between the pastoral 
     cottage and the old hall residence of the knight or esquire. Such houses differ much from the rugged cottages before described, and are generally graced with a little court or garden in

    <p rend='indent'>   All gross transgressions of this kind originate, doubtless, in a feeling natural and honourable to the human mind, viz. the pleasure which it receives from distinct

    <p>smitten by formality and harsh contrast. But I would beg of those who are eager to create the means of such gratification, first carefully to study what already exists; and they will 
     find, in a country so lavishly gifted by nature, an abundant variety of forms marked out with a precision that will satisfy their desires. Moreover, a new habit of pleasure will be formed
     opposite to this, arising out of the perception of the fine gradations by which in nature one thing passes away into another, and the boundaries that constitute individuality disappear in
     one instance only to be revived elsewhere under a more alluring form. <placeName>The hill of Dunmallet</placeName>, at the foot of <placeName>Ulswater</placeName>, was once divided into different portions, by avenues of fir trees, 
     with a green and almost perpendicular lane descending down the steep hill through each avenue; - contrast this quaint appearance with the image of the same hill overgrown with self planted 
     wood, - each tree springing up in the situation best suited to its kind, and with that shape which the situation constrained or suffered it to take. What endless melting and playing into each other
    of forms and colours does the one offer to a mind at once attentive and active; and how insipid and lifeless,compared with it, appear those parts of the former exhibition with which a child, 
    a peasant perhaps, or a citizen unfamiliar with natural imagery, whould have been most delighted!</p>

    <p>undergone, has not, however, proceeded wholly from the common feelings of human nature which have been referred to as the primary sources of bad taste in rural imagery; another cause
     must be added, that has chiefly shown itself in its effect upon buildings. I mean a warping of the natural mind occasioned by a consciousness that, this country being an object of general 
     admiration, every new house would be looked at and commented upon either for approbation or censure. Hence all the deformity and ungracefulness that ever pursue the steps of constraint or 
     affectation. Persons, who in <placeName>Leicestershire</placeName> or <placeName>Northamptonshire</placeName> would probably have built a modest dwelling like those of their sensible neighbours, have been turned out of their course; 
     and, acting a part, no wonder if, having had little experience, they act it ill. The craving for prospect, also, which is immoderate, particularly in new settlers, has rendered it 
     impossible that buildings, whatever might have been their architecture, should in most instances be ornamental to the landscape; rising as they do from the summits of naked hills in staring 
    contrast to the snugness and privacy of the ancient houses.</p>

     who may be styled the co partner and sister of Nature, be not denied the respect to which she is entitled. I have already spoken of the beautiful forms of the ancient mansions of this
     country, and of the happy manner in which they harmonise with the forms of nature. Why cannot such be taken as a model, and modern internal convenience be confined within their external
     grace and dignity. Expense to be avoided, or difficulties to be overcome, may prevent a close adherence to this model; still, however, it might be followed to a certain degree in the style
     of architecture and in the choice of situation, if the thirst for prospect were mitigated by those considerations of comfort, shelter, and convenience, which used to be chiefly sought
     after. But should an aversion to old fashions unfortunately exist, acompanied with a desire to transplant into the cold and stormy North, the elegancies of a villa formed upon a model taken from countries

     been little adverted to, are evident. Mountainous countries, more frequently and forcibly than others, remind us of the power of the elements, as manifested in winds, snows, and torrents,
    and accordingly make the notion of exposure very unpleasing; while shelter and comfort are in proportion necessary and acceptable. Far-winding vallies difficult of access, and the feelings of simplicity
    habitually connected with mountain retirements, prompt us to turn from ostentation as a thing there eminently unnatural and out of place. A mansion, amid such scenes, can never have

    <p>and, itself being a work of art, works and traces of artificial ornament may, without censure, be extended around it, as they will be referred to the common centre, the house; the 
     right of which to impress within certain limits a character of obvious ornament will not be denied, where no commanding forms of nature dispute it, or set it aside. Now, to a want of 
     the perception of this difference, and to the causes before assigned, may chiefly be attributed the disfigurement which <placeName>the Country of the Lakes</placeName> has undergone, from persons who may have
     built, demolished, and planted, with full confidence, that every change and addition was or would become an improvement.</p>
    <p rend='indent'>   The principle that ought to determine the position, apparent size, and architecture of a house, viz. that it should be so constructed, and (if large) so much of it
     hidden, as to admit of its being gently incorporated into the scenery of nature - should also determine its colour. <persName>Sir Joshua Reynolds</persName> used to say, &quot;If you would fix upon the
     best colour for your house, turn up a stone, or pluck up a handful of grass by the roots, and see what is the colour of the soil where the house is to stand, and let that be your
     choice.&quot; Of course, this precept given in conversation, could not have been meant to be taken literally. For example, in <placeName>Low Furness</placeName>, where the soil, from its strong impregnation 
     with iron, is universally of a deep red, if this rule</p>
    <pb n="105" facs="27735.jp2"/>
    <p>COLOURING OF BUILDINGS.</p>
    <p><seg type='pagenumber'>71</seg></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>were strictly followed, the house also must be of a glaring red; in other places it must be of a sullen black; which would only be adding annoyance to annoyance. The rule, however,
     as a general guide, is good; and, in agricultural districts, where large tracts of soil are laid bare by the plough, particularly if (the face of the country being undulating) they are
     held up to view, this rule, though not to be implicitly adhered to, should never be lost sight of; - the colour of the house ought, if possible, to have a cast or shade of the colour 
     of the soil. The principal is, that the house must harmonise with the surrounding landscape: accordingly, in mountainous countries, with still more confidence may it de said, &quot;look 
     at the rocks and those parts of the mountains where the soil is visible, and they will furnish a safe direction.&quot; Nevertheless, it will often happen that the rocks may bear so
     large a proportion to the rest of the landscape, and may be of such a tone of colour, that the rule may not admit, even here, of being implicitly followed. For instance, the chief defect in 
    the colouring of <placeName>the Country of the Lakes</placeName> (which is most strongly felt in the summer season) is an over-prevalence of a bluish tint, which th egreen of the herbage, the fern, and the woods, 
    does not sufficiently counteract. If a house, therefore, should stand where this defect prevails, I have no hesitation in saying, that the colour of the neighbouring rocks would not be the best
    that</p>

    <p>could be chosen. A tint ought to be introduced approaching nearer to those which, in the technical language of painters, are called <emph>warm</emph>: this, if happily selected, would
     not disturb, but would animate the landscape. How often do we see this exemplified upon a small scale by the native cottages, in cases where the glare of white wash has been subdued by 
     time and enriched by weather stains! No harshness is then seen; but one of these cottages, thus coloured, will often form a central point to a landscape by which the whole shall be
     connected, and an influence of pleasure diffused over all the objects that compose the picture. But where the cold blue tint of the rocks is enriched by the iron tinge, the colour cannot 
     be too closely imitated; and it will be produced of itself by the stones hewn from the adjoining quarry, and by the mortar, which may be tempered with the most gravelly part of the soil.
     The pure blue gravel, from the bed of the river, is, however, more suitable to the mason's purpose, who will probably insist also that the house must be covered with rough-cast, otherwise
    it cannot be kept dry; if this advise be taken, the builder of taste will set about contriving such means as may enable him to come the nearest to the effect aimed at.</p>
    <p rend='indent'>The supposed necessity of rough-cast to keep out rain in houses not built of hewn stone or brick, has tended greatly to injure <trait type="ethnicity"><label>English</label></trait> landscape, and the neighbourhood of these</p>

    <p>Lakes especially, by furnishing such apt occasion for whitening buildings. That white should be a favorite colour for rural residences is natural for many reasons. The mere aspect of 
     cleanliness and neatness thus given, not only to an individual house, but, where the practice is general, to the whole face of the country, produces moral associations so powerful, that,
     in many minds, they take place of all others. But what has already been said upon the subject of cottages, must have convinced men of feeling and imagination, that a human dwelling of the
     humblest class may be rendered more deeply interesting to the affections, and far more pleasing to the eye, by other influences, than a sprightly tone of colour spread over its outside. I 
     do not, however, mean to deny, that a small white building, embowered in trees, may, in some situations, be a delightful and animating object - in no way injurious to the landscape; but 
     this only where it sparkles from the midst of a thick shade, and in rare and solitary instances; especially if teh country be itself rich and pleasing, and abound with grand forms. On the sides
    of bleak and desolate moors, we are indeed thankful for the sight of white cottages and white houses plentifully scattered, where, without these, perhaps every thing would be cheerless: this is said,
    however, without hesitation, and with a wilful sacrifice of some higher enjoyments. But I have certainly seen such buildings glittering at sunrise, and in wandering lights, with no common pleasure.</p>

    <p><roleName>The continental traveller</roleName> also will remember, that the convents hanging from the rocks of <placeName>the Rhine</placeName>, <placeName>the Rhone</placeName>, <placeName>the Danube</placeName>, or among <placeName>the Appenines</placeName>, or <placeName>the mountains of Spain</placeName>, are not looked at with less complacency when, as is often the case, they happen to be of a brilliant white. But this is perhaps owing, in no small degree, to the contrast of that lively colour with the gloom of monastic life, and to the general want of rural residences of smiling and attractive appearance, in those countries.</p>
    <p rend='indent'>   The objections to white, as a colour, in large spots or masses in landscape, especially in a mouatainous country, are insurmountable. In nature, pure white is scarcely ever found but in small objects, such as flowers; or in those which are transitory, as the clouds, foam of rivers, and snow. <persName>Mr. Gilpin</persName>, who notices this, has also recorded the just remark of Mr.</p>
    <p><persName>Locke, of N -</persName>, that white destroys the gradations of distance; and, therefore, an object of pure white is scarcely ever found but in small objects, such as flowers; or in those
    which are trnasitory, as the clouds, foam of rivers, and snow. <persName>Mr. Gilpin</persName>, who notices this, has also recorded the just remark of <persName>Mr. Locke, of Nâ€”</persName>, that white destorys the <emph>gradations</emph>
    of distance; and, tehrefore, an object of pure white can scarecely ever be managed with good effect in landscape-painting. Five or six white houses, scattered over a valley, by their
    obtrusiveness, dot the surface, and divide into triangles, or other mathematical figures, haunting the eye, and disturbing that repose which ight otherwise be perfect. I have seen a single white house
    materially impair the majesty of a mountain; cutting away, by a harsh separation, the whole of its base, below the point on which the house stood. Thus was the apparent size of the mountain reduced,

    <pb n="109" facs="27739.jp2"/>

    <p><seg type='pagenumber'>75</seg></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>not by the interposition of another object in a manner to call forth the imagination, which will give more than the eye loses; but what had been abstracted in this case was left visible;
     and the mountain appeared to take its beginning, or to rise, from the line of the house, instead of its own natural base. But, if I may express my own individual feeling, it is after
     sunset, at the coming on of twilight, that white objects are most to be complained of. The solemnity and quietness of nature at that time are always marred, and often destroyed by them.
     When the ground is covered with snow, they are of course inoffensive; and in moonshine they are always pleasing - it is a tone of light with which they accord: and the dimness of the scene
     is enlivened by an object at once conspicuous and cheerful. I will conclude this subject with noticing, that the cold, slaty colour, which many persons, who have heard the white condemned,
     have adopted in its stead, must be disapproved of for the reason already given. The flaring yellow runs into the opposite extreme, and is still more censurable. Upon the whole, the safest
    colour, for general use, is something between a cream and a dust-colour, commonly called stone colour; â€” there are, among the Lakes, examples of this that need to be pointed out.*</p>

    <p>THE LARCH.</p>
    <p rend='indent'>   The principle taken as our guide, viz. that the house should be so formed, and of such apparent size and colour, as to admit of its being gently incorporated with
     the works of nature, should also be applied to the management of the grounds and plantations, and is here more urgently needed; for it is from abuses in this department, far more even 
     than from the introduction of exotics in architecture (if the phrase may be used), that this country has suffered. Larch and fir plantations have been spread, not merely with a view to 
     profit, but in many instances for the sake of ornament. To those who plant for profit, and are thrusting every other tree out of the way, to make room for their favourite, the larch, I 
     would utter first a regret, that they should have selected these lovely vales for their vegetable manufactory, when there is so much barren and irreclaimable land in the neighbouring
     moors, and in other parts of the island, which might have been had for this purpose at a far cheaper rate. And I will also beg leave to represent to them, that they ought not to be 
     carried away by flattering promises from the speedy growth of this tree; because in rich soils and sheltered situations, the wood, though it thrives fast, is full of sap, and of little 
     value; and is, likewise, very subject to ravage from the attacks of insects, and from blight. Accordingly, in <placeName>Scotland</placeName>, where planting is much better understood, and carried on upon an 
     incomparably larger scale than among us, good soil and sheltered situations are appropriated to the oak, the ash,</p>

    <p>PLANTING.</p>
    <p><seg type='pagenumber'>77</seg></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>and other deciduous trees; and the larch is now generally confined to barren and exposed ground. There the plant, which is a hardy one, is of slower growth; much less liable to
     injury; and the timber is of better quality. But the circumstances of many permit, and their taste leads them, to plant with little regard to profit; and there are others, less 
     wealthy, who have such a lively feeling of the native beauty of these scenes, that they are laudably not unwilling to make some sacrifices to heighten it. Both these classes of
     persons, I would entreat to enquire of themselves wherein that beauty which they admire consists. They would then see that, after the feeling has been gratified that prompts us to 
     gather round our dwelling a few flowers and shrubs, which from the circumstance of their not being native, may, by their very looks, remind us that they owe their existence to our
     hands, and their prosperity to our care; they will see that, after this natural desire has been provided for, the course of all beyond has been predetermined by the spirit of the 
     place. Before I proceed, I will remind those who are not satisfied with the restraint thus laid upon them, that they are liable to a charge of inconsistency, when they are so eager
     to change the face of that country, whose native attractions, by the act of erecting their habitations in it, they have so emphatically acknowledged. And surely there is not a single
     spot that would not have, if well managed, sufficient dignity to support itself,</p>

    <p>unaided by the productions of other climates, or by elaborate decorations which might be becoming elsewhere.</p>
    <p rend='indent'>   Having adverted to the feelings that justify the introduction of a few exotic plants, provided they be confined almost to the doors of the house, we may add, that a 
     transition should be contrived, without abruptness, from these <roleName>foreigners</roleName> to the rest of the shrubs, which ought to be of the kinds scattered by Nature, through the woods - holly, 
     broom, wild rose, elder, dogberry, white and black thorn, &amp;c.- either these only, or such as are carefully selected in consequence of their being united in form, and harmonising
     in colour with them, especially with respect to colour, when the tints are most diversified, as in autumn and spring. The various sorts of fruit and blossom bearing trees usually found
     in orchards, to which may be added those of the woods, - namely, the wilding, black cherry tree, and wild cluster cherry (here called heck berry) - may be happily admitted as an 
    intermediate link between the shrubs and the forest trees; which last ought almost entirely to be such as are natives of the country. Of the birch, one of them most beautiful of the native
    trees, it may be noticed, that, in dry and rocky situations, it oustrips even the larch, which many persons are tempted to plant merely on account of the speed of its growth. The <trait type="ethnicity"><label>Scotch</label></trait>
    fir is less attractive during its youth than any other plant; but, when full-grown, if it has had room to spread out its</p>

    <p>arms, it becomes a noble tree; and, by those who are disinterested enough to plant for posterity, it may be placed along with the sycamore near the house; for, from their massiveness,
     both these trees unite well with buildings, and in some situations with rocks also; having, in their forms and apparent substances, the effect of something intermediate betwixt the 
     immoveableness and solidity of stone, and the spray and foliage of the lighter trees. If these general rules be just, what shall we say to whole acres of artificial shrubbery and 
     exotic trees among rocks and dashing torrents, with their own wild wood in sight â€” where we have the whole contents of the nurseryman's catalogue jumbled together - colour at war with
     colour, and form with form?- among the most peaceful subjects of Nature's kingdom, everywhere discord, distraction, and bewilderment! But this deformity, bad as it is, is not so obtrusive
     as the small patches and large tracts of larch plantations that are overrunning the hill sides. To justify our condemnation of these, let us again recur to Nature. The process, by which she forms 
    woods and forests, is as follows. Seeds are scattered indiscriminately by winds, brought by waters, and dropped by birds. They perish, or produce, according as the soil and situation upon which 
    they fall are suited to them: and under the same dependence, the seedling or the sucker, if not cropped by animals, (which Nature is often careful to prevent by fencing it</p>

     some law imposed upon it by its neighbours. From low and sheltered places, vegetation travels upwards to the more exposed; and the young plants are protected, and to a certain degree
     fashioned, by those that have preceeded them. The continuous mass of foliage which would be thus produced, is broken by rocks, or by glades or open places, where the browzing of animals 
     has prevented the growth of wood. As vegetation ascends, the winds begin also to bear their part in moulding the forms of the trees; but, thus mutually protected, trees, though not of the
     hardiest kind, are enabled to climb high up the mountains. Gradually, however, by the quality of the ground, and by increasing exposure, a stop is put to their ascent; the hardy trees only 
     are left: those also, by little and little, give way - and a wild and irregular boundary is established, graceful in its outline, and never contemplated without some feeling, more or less 
    distinct, of the powers of Nature by which it is imposed.</p>
    <p rend='indent'>Contrast the liberty that encourages, and the law that limits, this joint work of nature and time, with the disheartening neccessities, restrictions, and disadvantages, 
    under which the artificial planter must be processed, even he whom long observation and fine feeling have best qualified for his task. In the first place his trees, how-</p>

     sympathy and organization, if I may so express myself, which pervades the whole of a natural wood, and appears to the eye in its single trees, its masses of foliage, and their various
     colours, when they are held up to view on the side of a mountain; or when, spread over a valley, they are looked down upon from an eminence. It is therefore impossible, under any 
     circumstances, for the artificial planter to rival the beauty of nature. But a moment's thought will show that, if ten thousand of this spiky tree, the larch, are stuck in at once upon
     the side of a hill, they can grow up into nothing but deformity; that, while they are suffered to stand, we shall look in vain for any of those appearances which are the chief sources
     of beauty in a natural wood.</p>
    <p rend='indent'>   It must be acknowledged that the larch, till it has outgrown the size of a shrub, shows, when looked at singly, some elegance in form and appearance, especially in spring, 
    decorated, as it then is, by the pink tassels of its blossoms; but, as a tree, it is less than any other pleasing: its branches (for <emph>boughs</emph> it has none) have no variety in the
    youth of the tree, and little dignity, even when it attains its full growth; <emph>leaves</emph> it cannot be said to have, consequently neither affords shade nor shelter. In spring the larch becomes
    green long before</p>

    <p>the native trees; and its green is so peculiar and vivid, that, finding nothing to harmonize with it, wherever it comes forth, a disagreeable speck is produced. In summer, when all other
     trees are in their pride, it is of a dingy lifeless hue; in autumn of a spiritless unvaried yellow, and in winter it is still more lamentably distinguished from every other deciduous tree
     of the forest, for they seem only to sleep, but the larch appears absolutely dead. If an attempt be made to mingle thickets, or a certain proportion of other forest trees, with the larch,
     its horizontal branches intolerantly cut them down as with a scythe, or force them to spindle up to keep pace with it. The terminating spike renders it impossible that the several trees,
     where planted in numbers, should ever blend together so as to form a mass or masses of wood. Add thousands to tens of thousands, and the appearance is still the same - a collection of
     separate individual trees, obstinately presenting themselves as such; and which, from whatever point they are looked at, if but seen, may be counted upon the fingers. Sunshine, or shadow,
     has little power to adorn the surface of such a wood; and the trees not carrying up their heads, the wind raises among them no majestic undulations. It is indeed true, that, in countries 
     where the larch is a native, and where, without interruption, it may sweep from valley to valley, and from hill to hill, a sublime image may be produced by such a forest, in the same 
     manner as</p>

    <p>by one composed of any other single tree, to the spreading of which no limits can be assigned. For sublimity will never be wanting, where the sense of innumerable multitude is lost in, 
     and alternates with, that of intense unity; and to the ready perception of this effect, similarity and almost identity of individual form and monotony of colour contribute. But this
     feeling is confined to the native immeasurable forest; no artificial plantation can give it.</p>
    <p rend='indent'>   The foregoing observations will, I hope, (as nothing has been condemned or recommended without a substantial reason) have some influence upon those who plant for 
     ornament merely. To such as plant for profit, I have already spoken. Let me then entreat that the native deciduous trees may be left in complete possession of the lower ground; and that
     plantations of larch, if introduced at all, may be confined to the highest and most barren tracts. Interposition of rocks would there break the dreary uniformity of which we have been
     complaining; and the winds would take hold of the trees, and imprint upon their shapes a wildness congenial to their situation.</p>
    <p rend='indent'>   Having determined what kinds of trees must be wholly rejected, or at least very sparingly used, by those who are unwilling to disfigure the country; and having shown
     what kinds ought to be chosen; I should have given, if my limits had not already been overstepped, a few practical rules for the manner in which trees</p>

    <p>ought to be disposed in planting. But to this subject I should attach little importance, if I could succeed in banishing such trees as introduce deformity, and could prevail upon the 
     <roleName>proprietor</roleName> to confine himself, either to those found in the native woods, or to such as accord with them. This is, indeed, the main point; for, much as these scenes have been injured by 
     what has been taken from them - buildings, trees, and woods, either through negligence, necessity, avarice, or caprice - it is not the removals, but the harsh additions that have been 
     made, which are the worst grievance - a standing and unavoidable annoyance. Often have I felt this distinction, with mingled satisfaction and regret; for, if no positive deformity or
     discordance be substituted or super induced, such is the benignity of Nature, that, take away from her beauty after beauty, and ornament after ornament, her appearance cannot be marred -
     the scars, if any be left, will gradually disappear before a healing spirit; and waht remains will still be soothing and pleasing. â€”</p>

    <p>ravage as is here &quot;deplored,&quot; could now he committed. But, out of the numerous copses, fine woods might in time be raised, probably without sacrifice of profit, by leaving, at 
     the periodical fellings, a due proportion of the healthiest trees to grow up into timber.-This plan has fortunately, in many instances, been adopted; and they, who have set the example, 
     are entitled to the thanks of all persons of taste. As to the management of planting with reasonable attention to ornament, let the images of nature be your guide, and the whole secret
     lurks in a few words; thickets or underwoods- single trees - trees clustered or in groups - groves - unbroken woods, but with varied masses of foliage - glades - invisible or winding 
     boundaries - in rocky districts, a seemly proportion of rock left wholly bare, and other parts half hidden - disagreeable objects concealed, and formal lines broken - trees climbing up to
     the horizon, and, in some places, ascending from its sharp edge, in which they are rooted, with the whole body of the tree appearing to stand in the clear sky - in other parts, woods 
     surmounted by rocks utterly bare and naked, which add to the sense of height, as if vegetation could not thither be carried, and impress a feeling of duration, power of resistance, and

    <p>tably follow, from the change of <roleName>inhabitants</roleName> and <roleName>owners</roleName> which is rapidly taking place. - About the same time that strangers began to be attracted to the country, and to feel a desire to 
     settle in it, the difficulty, that would have stood in the way of their procuring situations, was lessened by an unfortunate alteration in the circumstances of the native peasantry,
     proceeding from a cause which then began to operate, and is now felt in every house. The family of each man, whether <roleName><emph>estatesman</emph></roleName> or <roleName>farmer</roleName>, formerly had a twofold support; first, the
     produce of his lands and flocks; and, secondly, the profit drawn from the employment of the <roleName>women</roleName> and <roleName>children</roleName>, as <roleName>manufacturers</roleName>; spinning their own wool in their own houses (work chiefly
     done in the winter season), and carrying it to market for sale. Hence, however numerous the <roleName>children</roleName>, the income of the family kept pace with its increase. But, by the invention and
     universal application of machinery, this second resource has been cut off; the gains being so far reduced, as not to be sought after but by a few aged persons disabled from other employment. 
    Doubtless, the invention of machinery has not been to these people a pure loss; for the profits arising from home-manufactures operated as a strong temptation to choose that mode of labour
    in neglect of husbandry. They also participate in the general benefit which the island has derived from the increased value of the produce of land, brought about by the estab-</p>

    <p>lishment of manufactories, and in the consequent quickening of agricultural industry. But this is far from making them amends; and now that home manufactures are nearly done away, though
     the <roleName>women</roleName> and <roleName>children</roleName> might, at many seasons of the year, employ themselves with advantage in the fields beyond what they are accustomed to do, yet still all possible exertion in this
     way cannot be rationally expected from persons whose agricultural knowledge is so confined, and, above all, where there must necessarily be so small a capital. The consequence, then, is 
     that <roleName>proprietors</roleName> and <roleName>farmers</roleName> being no longer able to maintain themselves upon small farms, several are united in one, and the buildings go to decay, or are destroyed; and that the lands 
     of the <roleName>estatesmen</roleName> being mortgaged, and the <roleName>owners</roleName> constrained to part with them, they fall into the hands of <roleName>wealthy purchasers</roleName>, who in like manner unite and consolidate; and, if they wish
     to become <roleName>residents</roleName>, erect new mansions out of the ruins of the ancient cottages, whose little enclosures, with all the wild graces that grew out of them, disappear. The feudal tenure
     under which the estates are held has indeed done something towards checking this influx of new <roleName>settlers</roleName>; but so strong is the inclination, that these galling restraints are endured; and
     it is probable, that in a few years <placeName>the country on the margin of the Lakes</placeName> will fall almost entirely into the possession of <roleName>gentry</roleName>, <roleName>cither</roleName> <roleName>strangers</roleName> or <roleName>natives</roleName>. It is then</p>

    <p>much to be wished, that a better taste should prevail among these new <roleName>proprietors</roleName>; and, as they cannot be expected to leave things to themselves, that skill and knowledge should prevent
     unnecessary deviations from that path of simplicity and beauty along which, without design and unconsciously, their humble predecessors have moved. In this wish the <roleName>author</roleName> will be joined 
     by persons of pure taste throughout the whole island, who, by their visits (often repeated) to <placeName>the Lakes in the North of England</placeName>, testify that they deem the district a sort of national
     property, in which every man has a right and interest who has an eye to perceive and a heart to enjoy.</p>

    <p></p>
    <p><persName>MR. WEST</persName>, in his well known Guide to the Lakes, recommends, as the best season for visiting this country, the interval from <date>the beginning of June to the end of August</date>; and, the two
     latter months being a time of vacation and leisure, it is almost exclusively in these that <roleName>strangers</roleName> resort hither. But that season is by no means the best; the colouring of the
     mountains and woods, unless where they are diversified by rocks, is of too unvaried a green; and, as a large portion of the vallies is allotted to hay grass, some want of variety 
     is found there also. The meadows, however, are sufficiently enlivened after hay making begins, which is much later than in the southern part of the island. A stronger objection is
     rainy weather, setting in sometimes at this period with a vigour, and continuing with a perseverance, that may remind the disappointed and dejected traveller</p>

    <p>of those deluges of rain which fall among the <trait type="ethnicity"><label>Abyssinian</label></trait> mountains, for the annual supply of <placeName>the Nile</placeName>. <date>The months of September and October</date> (particularly October) are generally 
     attended with much finer weather; and the scenery is then, beyond comparison, more diverisficd, more splendid, and beautiful; but, on the other hand, short days prevent long excursions,
     and sharp and chill gales are unfavourable to parties of pleasure out of doors. Nevertheless, to <roleName>the sincere admirer of nature</roleName>, who is in good health and spirits, and at liberty to
     make a choice, <date>the six weeks following the 1st of September</date> may be recommended in preference to <date>July and August</date>. For there is no inconvenience arising from the season which, to such 
     a person, would not be amply compensated by the <emph>autumnal</emph> appearance of any of the more retired vallies, into which discordant plantations and unsuitable buildings have not yet found
     entrance.  In such spots, at this season, there is an admirable compass and proportion of natural harmony in colour, through the whole scale of objects; in the tender green of the
     after grass upon the meadows, interspersed with islands of grey or mossy rock, crowned by shrubs and trees; in the irregular inclosures of standing corn, or stubble fields, in like
     manner broken; in the mountain sides glowing with fern of divers colours; in the calm blue lakes and river pools; and in the foliage of the trees, through all the tints of autumn,
     from the pale and brilliant yellow</p>

    <p>of the birch and ash, to the deep greens of the unfaded oak and alder, and of the ivy upon the rocks, upon the trees, and the cottages. Yet, as most <roleName>travellers</roleName> are either stinted, 
     or stint themselves, for time, the space between <date>the middle or last week in May</date>, and <date>the middle or last week of June</date>, may be pointed out as affording the best combination of long days,
     fine weather, and variety of impressions. Few of the native trees are then in full leaf; but, for whatever may be wanting in depth of shade, more than an equivalent will be found in 
     the diversity of foliage, in the blossoms of the fruit and berry bearing trees which abound in the woods, and in the golden flowers of the broom and other shrubs, with which many of
     the copses are interveined. In those woods, also, and on these mountainsides which have a northern aspect, and in the deep dells, many of the spring flowers still linger; while the 
     open and sunny places are stocked with the flowers of the approaching summer. And, besides, is not an exquisite pleasure still untasted by him who has not heard the choir of linnets 
     and thrushes chaunting their love songs in the copses, woods, and hedge rows of a mountainous country; safe from the birds of prey, which build in the inaccessible crags, and are at 
     all hours seen or heard wheeling about in the air? The number of these formidable creatures is probably the cause, why, in the <emph>narrow</emph> vallies, there are no skylarks; as the destroyer

     almost all the other tribes of our <trait type="ethnicity"><label>English</label></trait> warblers are numerous; and their notes, when listend to by the side of broad still waters, or when heard in unison with the murmuring of
     mountain brooks, have the compass of their power enlarged accordingly. There is also an imaginative influence in the voice of the cuckoo, when that voice has taken possession of a
     deep mountain valley, very different from anything which can be excited by the same sound in a flat country. Nor must a circumstance be omitted, which here renders the dose of spring
     especially interesting; I mean the practice of bringing down the ewes from the mountains to yean in the vallies and enclosed grounds. The herbage being thus cropped as it springs, <emph>that</emph>
     first tender emerald green of the season, which would otherwise have lasted little more than a fortnight, is prolonged in the pastures and meadows for many weeks: while they are 
     farther enlivened by the multitude of lambs bleating and skipping about. These sportive creatures, as they gather strength, are turned out upon the open mountains, and with their 
     slender limbs, their snow white colour, and their wild and light motions, beautifully accord or contrast with the rocks and lawns, upon which they must now begin to seek their food.

     the time and manner of an excursion of this kind are mostly regulated by circumstances which prevent an entire freedom of choice. It will therefore be more pleasant to observe, that,
     though <date>the months of July and August</date> are liable to many objections, yet it often happens that the weather, at this time, is not more wet and stormy than they, who are really capable
     of enjoying the sublime forms of nature in their utmost sublimity, would desire. For no <roleName>traveller</roleName>, provided he be in good health, and with any command of time, would have a just privilege 
     to visit such scenes, if lie could grudge the price of a little confinement among them, or interruption in his journey, for the sight or sound of a storm coming on or clearing away. 
     Insensible must he be who would not congratulate himself upon the bold bursts of sunshine, the descending vapours, wandering lights and shadows, and the invigorated torrents and 
     waterfalls, with which broken weather, in a mountainous region, is accompanied. At such a time there is no cause to complain, either of the monotony of midsummer colouring, or the glaring
     atmosphere of long, cloudless, and hot days.</p>

    <p>in which objects are best seen  a lake being composed of water flowing from higher grounds, and expanding itself till its receptacle is filled to the brim,  it follows, that it will 
     appear to most advantage when approached from its outlet, especially if the lake be in a mountainous country; for, by this way of approach, the traveller faces the grander features of the
     scene, and is gradully conducted into its most sublime recesses. Now, every one knows, that from amenity and beauty the transition to sublimity is easy and favourable; but the reverse is 
     not so; for, after the faculties have been elevated, they are indisposed to humbler excitement.*</p>
    <p rend='indent'>   It is not likely that a mountain will be ascended without disappointment, if a wide range of prospect be the object, unless either the summit be reached before sun rise,
     or the <roleName>visitant</roleName> remain there until the time of sun set, and afterwards. The precipitous sides of the mountain, and the neighbouring summits, may</p>

     to the west the clustering mountains of <placeName>Newlands</placeName>. <placeName>Lowes water</placeName> is tame at the head, but towards its outlet has a magnificent assemblage of mountains. Yet as far as respects the formation
     of such receptacles, the general observation holds good; neither <placeName>Derwent</placeName> nor <placeName>Lowes water</placeName> derive any supplies from the streams of those mountains that dignify the landscape towards the

     extent of country partially, or, dispersing suddenly, reveal the whole region from centre to circumference.</p>
    <p rend='indent'>   A stranger to a mountainous country may not be aware that his walk in the early morning ought to be taken on the eastern side of the vale, otherwise he will lose the
     morning light, first touching the tops and thence creeping down the sides of the opposite hills, as the sun ascends, or he may go to some central eminence, commanding both the shadows 
     from the eastern, and the lights upon the western mountains. But, if the horizon line in the east be low, the western side may be taken for the sake of the reflections, upon the water,
     of light from the rising sun. In the evening, for like reasons, the contrary course should be taken.</p>

    <p></p>
    <p>trust ourselves, is a disposition to be pleased. For example, if a <roleName>traveller</roleName> be among <placeName>the Alps</placeName>, let him surrender up his mind to the fury of the gigantic torrents, and take delight, in
     the contemplation of their almost irresistible violence, without complaining of the monotony of their foaming course, or being disgusted with the muddiness of the water apparent even where 
     it is violently agitated. In <placeName>Cumberland</placeName> and <placeName>Westmorland</placeName>, let not the comparative weakness of the streams prevent him from sympathising with such impetuosity as they possess; and, making 
     the most of the present objects, let him, as he justly may do, observe with admiration the unrivalled brilliancy of the water, and that variety of motion, mood, and character, that arises 
     out of the want of those resources by which the power of the streams in <placeName>the Alps</placeName> is supported. Again, with respect to the mountains; though these are comparatively of diminutive size, 
     though there is little of perpetual snow, and no voice of summer avalanches is heard among them; and though traces left by the ravage of the elements are here comparatively rare and
     unimpressive, yet out of this very deficiency proceeds a sense of stability and permanence that is, to many minds, more grateful </p>

    <p>Havoc, and ruin, and desolation, and encroachment, are everywhere more or less obtruded; and it is difficult, notwithstanding the naked loftiness of the <emph>pikes</emph>, and the snow capped 
     summits of the <emph>mounts</emph>, to escape from the depressing sensation, that the whole are in a rapid process of dissolution; and, were it not that the destructive agency must abate as the 
     heights diminish, would, in time to come, be levelled with the plains. Nevertheless, I would relish to the utmost the demonstrations of every species of power at work to effect such 
     changes.</p>
    <p rend='indent'>   From these general views let us descend a moment to detail. A stranger to mountain imagery naturally on his first arrival looks out for sublimity in every object that 
     admits of it; and is almost always disappointed. For this disappointment there exists, I believe, no general preventive; nor is it desirable that there should. But with regard to one 
     class of objects, there is a point in which injurious expectations may be easily corrected. It is generally supposed that waterfalls are scarcely worth being looked at except after much 
     rain, and that, the more swoln the stream, the more fortunate the spectator; but this however is true only of large cataracts with sublime accompaniments; and not even of these without 
     some drawbacks. In other instances, what becomes, at such a time, of that sense of refreshing coolness which can only be felt in dry and sunny weather, when the rocks, herbs,</p>

     the smaller waterfalls or cascades consists in certain proportions of form and affinities of colour, among the component parts of the scene; and in the contrast maintained between the 
     falling water and that which is apparently at rest, or rather settling gradually into quiet in the pool below. The beauty of such a scene, where there is naturally so much agitation, is
     also heightened, in a peculiar manner, by the glimmering, and, towards the verge of the pool, by the steady, reflection of the surrounding images. Now, all those delicate distinctions are
     destroyed by heavy floods, and the whole stream rushes along in foam and tumultuous confusion. A happy proportion of component parts is indeed noticeable among the landscapes of <placeName>the North
     of England</placeName>; and, in this characteristic essential to a perfect picture, they surpass the scenes of <placeName>Scotland</placeName>, and, in a still greater degree, those of <placeName>Switzerland</placeName>.</p>
    <p rend='indent'>   As a resident among the Lakes, I frequently hear the scenery of this country compared with that of <placeName>the Alps</placeName>; and therefore a few words shall be added to what has been
     incidentally said upon that subject.</p>
    <p rend='indent'>   If we could recall, to this region of lakes, the native pine forests, with which many hundred years ago a large portion of the heights</p>

    <p>was covered, then, during spring and autumn, it might frequently, with much propriety, be compared to <placeName>Switzerland</placeName>,  the elements of the landscape would be the same  one country 
     representing the other in miniature. Towns, villages, churches, rural seats, bridges and roads: green meadows and arable grounds, with their various produce, and deciduous woods of
     diversified foliage which occupy the vales and lower regions of the mountains, would, as in <placeName>Switzerland</placeName>, be divided by dark forests from ridges and round topped heights covered with snow,
     and from pikes and sharp declivities imperfectly arrayed in the same glittering mantle: and the resemblance would be still more perfect on those days when vapours, resting upon, and 
     floating around the summits, leave the elevation of the mountains less dependent upon the eye than on the imagination. But the pine forests have wholly disappeared; and only during late
     spring and early autumn is realized here that assemblage of the imagery of different seasons, which is exhibited through the whole summer among <placeName>the Alps</placeName>,  winter in the distance,  and
     warmth, leafy woods, verdure and fertility at hand, and widely diffused.</p>
    <p rend='indent'>   Striking, then, from among the permanent materials of the landscape, that stage of vegetation which is occupied by pine forests, and, above that, the perennial snows,
     we have mountains, the highest of which little exceed 3000 feet, while some of <placeName>the Alps</placeName> do not fall</p>

    <p>short of 14,000 or 15,000, and 8,000 or 10,000 is not an uncommon elevation. Our tracts of wood and water are almost as diminutive in comparison; therefore, as far as sublimity is
     dependent upon absolute bulk and height, and atmospherical influences in connection with these, it is obvious, that there can be no rivalship. But a short residence among <placeName>the British 
     Mountains</placeName> will furnish abundant proof, that, after a certain point of elevation, viz. that which allows of compact and fleecy clouds settling upon, or sweeping over, the summits, the
     sense of sublimity depends more upon form and relation of objects to each other than upon their actual magnitude; and, that an elevation of 3000 feet is sufficient to call forth in a most
     impressive degree the creative, and magnifying, and softening powers of the atmosphere. Hence, on the score even of sublimity, the superiority of <placeName>the Alps</placeName> is by no means so great as might
     hastily be inferred;  and, as to the beauty of the lower regions of <placeName>the Swiss Mountains</placeName>, it is noticeable  that, as they are all regularly mown, their surface has nothing of that mellow
     tone and variety of hues by which mountain turf, that is never touched by the scythe, is distinguished. On the smooth and steep slopes of <placeName>the Swiss hills</placeName>, these plots of verdure do indeed
     agreeably unite their colour with that of the deciduous trees, or make a lively contrast with the dark green pine groves that define them, and among which they run in endless variety of 
     shapes</p>

    <p> but this is most pleasing at first sight; the permanent gratification of the eye requires finer gradations of tone, and a more delicate blending of hues into each other. Besides, it is 
     only in spring and late autumn that cattle animate by their presence the <trait type="ethnicity"><label>Swiss</label></trait> lawns; and, though the pastures of the higher regions where they feed during the summer are left in their
     natural state of flowery herbage, those pastures are so remote, that their texture and colour are of no consequence in the composition of any picture in which a lake of the Vales is a
     feature. Yet in those lofty regions, how vegetation is invigorated by the genial climate of that country! Among the luxuriant flowers there met with, groves, or forests, if I may so call 
     them, of Monks hood are frequently seen; the plant of deep, rich blue, and as tall as in our gardens; and this at an elevation where, in <placeName>Cumberland</placeName>, <placeName>Icelandic</placeName> moss would only be found,
     or the stony summits be utterly bare.</p>
    <p rend='indent'>   We have, then, for the colouring of <placeName>Switzerland</placeName>, principally a vivid green herbage, black woods, and dazzling snows, presented in masses with a grandeur to which no 
     one can be insensible; but not often graduated by Nature into soothing harmony, and so ill suited to the pencil, that though abundance of good subjects may be there found, they are not

     fine trees, of that species, are found scattered over the hill sides: birches also grow here and there in luxuriant beauty; but neither these, nor oaks, are ever a prevailing tree, nor 
     can even be said to be common; and the oaks, as far as I had an opportunity of observing, are greatly inferior to those of <placeName>Britain</placeName>. Among the interior vallies the proportion of beeches 
     and pines is so great that other trees are scarcely noticeable; and surely such woods are at all seasons much less agreeable than that rich and harmonious distribution of oak, ash,
     elm, birch, and alder, that formerly clothed the sides of <placeName>Snowdon</placeName> and <placeName>Helvellyn</placeName>; and of which no mean remains still survive at the head of <placeName>Ulswater</placeName>. On <placeName>the Italian side of the Alps</placeName>,

     magnificent <placeName>Lake of the four Cantons</placeName>, especially its noblest division, called <placeName>the Lake of Uri</placeName>, is not only much agitated by winds, but in the night time is disturbed from the bottom,
     as I was told, and indeed as I witnessed, without any apparent commotion in the air; and when at rest, the water is not pure to the eye, but of a heavy green hue  as is that of all the
     other lakes, apparently according to the degree in which they are fed by melted snows. If the <placeName>Lake of Geneva</placeName> furnish an exception, this is probably owing to its vast extent, which
     allows the water to deposit its impurities. The water of the <trait type="ethnicity"><label>English</label></trait> lakes, on the contrary, being of a crystalline clearness, the reflections of the surrounding hills are frequently 
     so lively, that it is scarcely possible to distinguish the point where the real object terminates, and its unsubstantial duplicate begins. The lower part of the <placeName>Lake of Geneva</placeName>, from 
     its narrowness, must be much less subject to agitation than the higher divisions, and, as the water is clearer than that of the other <trait type="ethnicity"><label>Swiss</label></trait> Lakes, it will frequently exhibit this
     appearance, though it is scarcely possible in an equal degree. During two comprehensive tours among <placeName>the Alps</placeName>, I did not observe, except on one of the smaller lakes, between <placeName>Lugano</placeName> and
     <placeName>Ponte Tresa</placeName>, a single instance of those beautiful repetitions</p>

    <p>of surrounding objects on the bosom of the water, which are so frequently seen here: not to speak of the fine dazzling trembling network, breezy motions, and streaks and circles of
     intermingled smooth and rippled water, which makes the surface of our lakes a field of endless variety. But among <placeName>the Alps</placeName>, where every thing tends to the grand and the sublime, in 
     surfaces as well as in forms, if the lakes do not court the placid reflections of land objects those of first rate magnitude make compensation, in some degree, by exhibiting those ever
     changing fields of green, blue, and purple shadows or lights, (one scarcely knows which to name them) that call to mind a sea prospect contemplated from a lofty cliff.</p>
    <p rend='indent'>   The subject of torrents and water falls has already been touched upon; but it may be added that in <placeName>Switzerland</placeName>, the perpetual accompaniment of snow upon the higher

     upon a work of enchantment, I could not but regret that my previous knowledge of the place enabled me to account for the appearance. It was in fact the reflection of a pleasure house
     called <placeName>Lyulphs Tower</placeName> the towers and battlements magnified and so much changed in shape as not to be immediately recognized. In the meanwhile, the pleasure house itself was altogether 
     hidden from my view by a body of vapour stretching over it and along the hill side on which it stands, but not so as to have intercepted its communication with the lake; and hence this
     novel and most impressive object, which, if I had been a stranger to the spot, would, from its being inexplicable, have long detained the mind in a state of pleasing astonishment.</p>

    <p>a friend, into view of <placeName>the Lake of Grasmere</placeName>, we were alarmed by the sight of a newly created Island; the transitory thought of the moment was, that it had been produced by an 
     earthquake or some other convulsion of nature. Recovering from the alarm, which was greater than the reader can possibly sympathize with, but which was shared to its full extent by my 
     companion, we proceeded to examine the object before us. The elevation of this new island exceeded considerably that of the old one, its neighbour; it was likewise larger in 
     circumference, comprehending a space of about five acres; its surface rocky, speckled with snow, and sprinkled over with birch trees; it was divided towards the south from the other
     island by a narrow frith, and in like manner from the northern shore of the lake; on the east and west it was separated from the shore by a much larger space of smooth water.</p>
    <p rend='indent'>   Marvellous was the illusion! Comparing the new with the old Island, the surface of which is soft, green, and unvaried, I do not scruple to say that, as an object of
     sight, it was much the more distinct. How little faith, we exclaimed, is due to one sense, unless its evidence be confirmed by some of its fellows! What Stranger could possibly be 
     persuaded that this, which we know to be an unsubstantial mockery, is <emph>really</emph> so; and that there exists only a single Island on this beautiful Lake? At length the appearance underwent

    <p>ed into a glimmering and dim <emph>inversion</emph>, and then totally disappeared; leaving behind it a clear open area of ice of the same dimensions. We now perceived that this bed 
     of ice, which was thinly suffused with water, had produced the illusion, by reflecting and refracting (as persons skilled in optics would no doubt easily explain) a rocky and woody 
     section of the opposite mountain named <placeName>Silver</placeName> how.</p>

     there subject. I have witnessed many tremendous thunder storms among <placeName>the Alps</placeName>, and the most glorious effects of light and shadow; but I never happened to be present when any Lake 
     was agitated by those hurricanes which I imagine must often torment them. If the commotions be at all proportionable to the expanse and depth of the waters, and the height of the 
     surrounding mountains, then, if I may judge from what is frequently seen here, the exibition must be awful and astonishing.  On this day, <date>March 30, 1822</date>, the winds have been 
     acting upon the small <placeName>Lake of Rydal</placeName>, as if they had received command to carry its waters from their bed into the sky; the white billows in different quarters disappeared under clouds,

     aloft till it lost its consistency and whiteness, was driven along the mountain tops like flying showers that vanish in the distance. Freduently an eddying wind scooped the waters out
     of the basin, and forced them upwards in the very shape of an <trait type="ethnicity"><label>Icelandic</label></trait> Geyser, or boiling fountain, to the height of several hundred feet.</p>
    <p rend='indent'>   This small <placeName>Mere of Ilydal</placeName>, from its position, is subject in a peculiar degree to these commotions. The present season, however, is unusually stormy;  great numbers

     <placeName>Alps</placeName> are inaccessible, being covered with everlasting snow, which commencing at regular heights above the cultivated tracts, or wooded and verdant sides, form indeed the highest
     contrast in nature. For there may be seen all the variety of climate in one view. To this, however, we oppose the sight of the ocean, from the summits of all the higher mountains, as

     thence beheld three distinct views; â€” on one side, the continuous Vale of <placeName>Borrowdale</placeName>, <placeName>Keswick</placeName>, and <placeName>Bassenthwaite</placeName>, â€” with <placeName>Skiddaw</placeName>, <placeName>Helvellyn</placeName>, <placeName>Saddle back</placeName>, and numerous other mountains, 
     and, in the distance, <placeName>the Solway Frith</placeName> and <placeName>the Mountains of Scotland</placeName>; â€” on the other side, and below us, <placeName>the Langdale Pikestheir</placeName> own vale below them; â€” <placeName>Windermere</placeName>, â€” and, far beyond
     <placeName>Windermere</placeName>, <placeName>Ingdeborough</placeName> in <placeName>Yorkshire</placeName>. But how shall I speak of the deliciousness of the third prospect! At this time, <emph>that</emph> was most favoured by sunshine and shade. The green Vale of
     <placeName>Esk</placeName> â€” deep and green, with its glittering serpent stream, lay below us; and, on we looked to the Mountains near the Sea, â€” <placeName>Black Comb</placeName> pre eminent, â€” and, still</p>

    <p></p>
    <p>beyond, to the Sea itself, in dazzling brightness. Turning round we saw <placeName>the Mountains of Wastdale</placeName> in tumult; to our right, <placeName>Great Gavel</placeName>, the loftiest, a distinct, and <emph>huge</emph> form,
     though the middle of the mountain was, to our eyes, as its base.</p>
    <p rend='indent'>   We had attained the object of this journey; but our ambition now mounted higher. We saw the summit of <placeName>Scaw fell</placeName>, apparently very near to us; and we shaped our course
     towards it; but, discovering that it could not be reached without first making a considerable descent, we resolved, instead, to aim at another point of the same mountain, called the 
     <placeName><emph>Pikes</emph></placeName>, which I have since found has been estimated as higher than the summit bearing the name of <placeName>Scawfell Head</placeName>, where <placeName>the Stone Man</placeName> is built.</p>
    <p rend='indent'>   The sun had never once been overshadowed by a cloud during the whole of our progress from the centre of <placeName>Borrowdale</placeName>. On the summit of the <placeName>Pike</placeName>, which we gained after
     much toil, though without difficulty, there was not a breath of air to stir even the papers containing our refreshment, as they lay spread out upon a rock. The stillness seemed to be 
     not of this world: â€” we paused, and kept silence to listen; and no sound could be heard: <placeName>the Scawfell Cataracts</placeName> were voiceless to us; and there was not an insect to hum in the air. The
     vales which we had seen from Ash course lay yet in view; and, side by side with <placeName>Eskdale</placeName>, we now saw the sister Vale of <placeName>Donnerdale</placeName> terminated by the <placeName>Duddon Sands</placeName>. But</p>

    <p>the majesty of the mountains below, and close to us, is not to be conceived. We now beheld the whole mass of <placeName>Great Gavel</placeName> from its base, â€” <placeName>the Den of Wastdale</placeName> at our feet â€” a gulph
     immeasurable: <placeName>Grasmire</placeName> and the other <placeName>mountains of Crummock</placeName> â€” <placeName>Ennerdale</placeName> and its mountains; and the Sea beyond! We sat down to our repast, and gladly would we have tempered our beverage 
     (for there was no spring or well near us) with such a supply of delicious water as we might have procured, had we been on the rival summit of <placeName>Great Gavel</placeName>; for on its highest point is
     a small triangular receptacle in the native rock, which, the <roleName>shepherds</roleName> say, is never dry. There we might have slaked our thirst plenteously with a pure and celestial liquid, for the
     cup or basin, it appears, has no other feeder than the dews of heaven, the showers, the vapours, the hoar frost, and the spotless snow.</p>
    <p rend='indent'>   While we were gazing around, "Look," I exclaimed, "at yon ship upon the glittering sea!"  "Is it a ship?" replied our <roleName>shepherd guide</roleName>. "It can be nothing else," interposed my
     companion; "I cannot be mistaken, I am so accustomed to the appearance of ships at sea." <roleName>The Guide</roleName> dropped the argument; but, before a minute was gone, he quietly said, "Now look at your 
     ship; it is changed into a horse." So indeed it was, â€” a horse with a gallant neck and head. We laughed heartily; and, I hope, when again inclined to be positive, I may remember the ship 
     and the</p>

    <p>horse upon the glittering sea; and the calm confidence, yet submissiveness, of our wise <roleName>Man of the Mountains</roleName>, who certainly had more knowledge of clouds than we, whatever might be
     our knowledge of ships.</p>
    <p rend='indent'>   I know not how long we might have remained on the summit of <placeName>the Pike</placeName>, without a thought of moving, had not our <roleName>Guide</roleName> warned us that we must not linger; for a storm
     was coming. We looked in vain to espy the signs of it. Mountains, values, and sea were touched with the clear light of the sun.  It is there, said he, pointing to the sea beyond
     <placeName>Whitehaven</placeName>, and there we perceived a light vapour unnoticeable but by a <roleName>shepherd</roleName> accustomed to watch all mountain bodings. We gazed around again, and yet again, unwilling to lose the
     remembrance of what lay before us in that lofty solitude; and then prepared to depart. Meanwhile the air changed to cold, and we saw that tiny vapours welled into mighty masses of 
     cloud which came boiling over the mountains. <placeName>Great Gavel</placeName>, <placeName>Helvellyn</placeName>, and <placeName>Skiddaw</placeName>, were wrapped in storm; yet <placeName>Langdale</placeName>, and the mountains in that quarter, remained all bright in sunshine.
     Soon the storm reached us; we sheltered under a crag; and almost as rapidly as it had come it passed away, and left us free to observe the struggles of gloom and sunshine in other 
     quarters. <placeName>Langdale</placeName> now had its share, and <placeName>the Pikes of Langdale</placeName> were decorated by two splendid rainbows. <placeName>Skiddaw</placeName> also had his own rainbows. Before we</p>

    <p>again readied Ash-course every cloud had vanished from every summit.</p>
    <p rend='indent'>   I ought to have mentioned that round the top of <placeName>Scawfell-PIKE</placeName> not a blade of grass is to be seen. Cushions or tufts of moss, parched and brown, appear between the
     huge blocks and stones that lie in heaps on all sides to a great distance, like skeletons or bones of the earth not needed at the creation, and there left to be covered with never-dying
     lichens, which the clouds and dews nourish ; and adorn with colours of vivid and exquisite beauty, dowers, the most brilliant feathers, and even gems, scarcely surpass in colouring 
     some of those masses of stone, which no human eye beholds, except the <roleName>shepherd</roleName> or <roleName>traveller</roleName> lie led thither by curiosity : and how seldom must this happen ! For the other eminence is 
     the one visited by <roleName>the adventurous stranger</roleName> ; and the <roleName>shepherd</roleName> has no inducement to ascend <placeName>the PIKE</placeName> in quest of his sheep; no food being there to tempt them.</p>
    <p rend='indent'>   We certainly were singularly favoured in the weather ; for when we were seated on the summit, our <roleName>conductor</roleName>, turning his eyes thoughtfully round, said, "I do not know
     that in my whole life, I was ever, at any season of the year, so high upon the mountains on so <emph>calm</emph> a day. (It was <date>the 7th of October</date>.) Afterwards we had a spectacle of the grandeur of
     earth and heaven commingled ; yet without terror. We knew that the storm would pass away; â€” for so our <roleName>prophetic Guide</roleName> had assured us.</p>

    <p>been unusually favourable to the preservation and beauty of foliage; and, far advanced as the season was, the trees on the larger <placeName>Island of Rydal-mere</placeName> retained a splendour which did
     not need the heightening of sunshine. We noticed, as we passed, that the line of the grey rocky shore of that island, shaggy with vane- gated bushes and shrubs, and spotted and striped
     with purplish brown heath, indistinguishably blending with its image reflected in the still water, produced a curious resemblance, both in form and colour, to a richly-coated 
     caterpillar, as it might appear through a magnifying glass of extraordinary power. The mists gathered as we went along: but, when we reached the top of <placeName>Kirkstone</placeName>, we were glad we had 
     not been discouraged by the apprehension of bad weather. Though not able to see a hundred yards before us, we were more than contented. At such a time, and in such a place, every
     scattered stone the size of ones head becomes a companion. Near the top of the Pass is the remnant of an old wall, which (magnified, though obscured, by the vapour) might have been
     taken for a fragment of some monument of ancient grandeur,yet that same pile of stones we had never before even observed. This situation, it must be allowed, is not favourable to 
     gaiety; but a pleasing hurry of spirits accompanies the surprise occasioned by objects transformed, dilated, or distorted, as they are when seen through such a medium. Many of the

    <p>the top and slopes of <placeName>Kirkstone</placeName>, and of similar places, are fantastic enough in themselves; but the full effect of such impressions can only he had in a state of weather when they
     are not likely to be sought for. It was not till we had descended considerably that the fields of <placeName>Hartshope</placeName> were seen, like a lake tinged by the reflection of sunny clouds: I mistook
     them for <placeName>Brothers-water</placeName>, but, soon after, we saw that Lake gleaming faintly with a steelly brightness,then, as we continued to descend, appeared the brown oaks, and the birdies of

    <p>morning, before we had seen these, I was reminded of that picturesque animal by two rams of mountain breed, both) with Ammonian horns, and with beards majestic as that which <persName>Michael 
     Angelo</persName> has given to his statue of <persName>Moses</persName>.â€” But to return; when our path had brought us to that part of the naked common which overlooks the woods and bush-besprinkled fields of <placeName>Blowick</placeName>,
     the lake, clouds, and mists were all in motion to the sound of sweeping winds;â€” the church and cottages of <placeName>Patterdale</placeName> scarcely visible, or seen only by fits between the shifting vapours.
     To the northward the scene was less visionary; â€” <placeName>Place Fell</placeName> steady and bold; the whole lake driving onward like a great riverâ€”waves dancing round the small islands. The house at <placeName>Blowick</placeName>
     was the boundary of our walk; and we returned, lamenting to see a decaying and uncomfortable dwelling in a place where sublimity and beauty seemed to contend with each other. But these
     regrets were dispelled by a glance on the woods that clothe the opposite steeps of the lake. How exquisite was the mixture of sober and splendid hues! The general colouring of the 
     trees was brownrather that of ripe hazel nuts; but towards the water, there were yet beds of green, and in the highest parts of the wood, was abundance of yellow foliage, which,
     gleaming through a vapoury lustre, reminded us of masses of clouds, as you see them gathered together in the west, and touched with the golden light of the setting sun.</p>

    <p>After dinner we walked up the Vale: I had never had an idea of its extent and width in passing along the public road on the other side, we followed the path that leads from house to
     house; two or three times it took us through some of those copses or groves that cover the little hillocks in the middle of the vale, making an intricate and pleasing intermixture of
     lawn and wood. Our fancies could not resist the temptation; and we fixed upon a spot for a cottage, which we began to build: and finished as easily as castles are raised in the air.
     Visited the same spot in the evening. I shall say nothing of the moonlight aspect of the situation which had charmed us so much in the afternoon; but I wish you had been with us when,
     in returning to our friends house, we espied his ladys large white dog, lying in the moonshine upon the round knoll under the old yew-tree in the garden, a romantic image the dark tree
     and its dark shadowand the elegant creature, as fair as a spirit! The torrents murmured softly: the mountains down which they were falling did not, to my sight furnish a back-ground 
     for this <persName>Ossianic</persName> picture; but I had a consciousness of the depth of the seclusion, and that mountains were embracing us on all sides;  I saw not, but I felt that they were there.</p>

    <p>large bay under <placeName>Place Fell</placeName>, three <roleName>fishermen</roleName> were dragging a net, a picturesque group beneath the high and bare crags! A raven was seen aloft; not hovering like the kite, for that is
     not the habit of the bird; but passing on with a straight-forward perseverance, and timing the motion of its wings to its own croaking. The waters were agitated; and the iron tone of 
     the ravens voice, which strikes upon the ear at all times as the more dolorous from its regularity, was in fine keeping with the wild scene before our eyes. This carniverous fowl is a
     great enemy to the lambs of these solitudes; I reccollect frequently seeing, when a boy, bunches of unfledged ravens suspended from the churchyard gates of H, for which a reward of so
     much a head was given to the adventurous destroyer.The <roleName>fishermen</roleName> drew their net ashore, and hundreds of fish were leaping in their prison. They were all of the kind called skellies, a 
     sort of fresh-water herring, shoals of which may sometimes be seen dimpling or rippling the surface of the lake in calm weather. This species is not found, I believe, in any other of
     these lakes; nor, as far as I know, is the chevin, that <emph>spiritless</emph> fish, (though I am loth to call it so, for it was a prime favourite with <persName>Isaac Walton</persName>,) which must frequent <placeName>Ullswater</placeName>,
     as I have seen a large shoal passing into the lake from the river <placeName>Eamont</placeName>. <emph>Here</emph> are no pike, and the char are smaller than those of the other lakes, and of inferior quality; but the
     grey trout attains a very large size, sometimes weighing above twenty pounds.</p>

    <p>This lordly creature seems to know that re-tiredness is a piece of majesty; for it is scarcely ever caught, or even seen, except when it quits the depths of the lake in the spawning
     season, and runs lip into the streams, where it is too often destroyed in disregard of the law of the land and of nature.</p>

     Crossed the one- arched bridge,â€” below the chapel, with its bare ring of mossy wall, and single yew-tree. At the last house in the dale we were greeted by the master, who was sitting
     at his door, with a Hock of sheep collected round him, for the purpose of smearing them with tar (according to the custom of the season) for protection against the winters cold. He
     invited us to enter, and view a room built by <persName>Mr. Hasell</persName> for the accommodation of his friends at the annual chase of red deer in his forests at the head of these dales. The room is

     mountains. On leaving <placeName>the fields of Sandwyke</placeName>, while ascending by a gentle slope along <placeName>the valley of Martindale</placeName>, we had occasion to observe that in thinly-peopled glens of this
     character the general want of wood gives a peculiar interest to the scattered cottages empowered in sycamore. Towards its head, this valley splits into two parts; and in one of these
     (that to the left) there is no house, nor any building to be seen but a cattle-shed on the side of a hill, which is sprinkled over with trees, evidently the remains of an extensive 
     forest. Near the entrance of the other division stands the house where we were entertained, and beyond the enclosures of that farm there are no other. A few old trees remain, relics 
     of the forest, a little stream hastens, though with serpentine windings, through the uncultivated hollow, where many cattle were pasturing. The cattle of this country are generally
     white, or light-coloured ; but these were dark brown, or black, which heightened the resemblance this scene bears to many parts of <placeName>the Highlands of Scotland</placeName>. While we paused to rest
     upon the hill-side, though well contented with the quiet every-day sounds the lowing of cattle, bleating of sheep, and the very gentle murmuring of the valley stream, we could not but
     think what a grand effect</p>

     district except the poor deer, the most ancient of them all. Our ascent even to the top was very easy; when it was accomplished we had exceedingly fine views, some of the lofty Fells
     being resplendent with sunshine, and others partly shrouded by clouds. <placeName>Ullswater</placeName>, bordered by black steeps, was of dazzling brightness; the plain beyond <placeName>Penrith</placeName> smooth and bright, or
     rather gleamy, as the sea or sea sands. Looked down into <placeName>Boardale</placeName>, which, like <placeName>Sty barrow</placeName>, has been named from the wild swine that formerly abounded here ; but it has now no sylvan
     covert, being smooth and bare, A long, narrow, deep, cradle-shaped glen, lying so sheltered that one would be pleased to see it planted by human hands, there being a sufficiency of 
     soil; and the trees would be sheltered almost like shrubs in a green-house. After having walked some way along the top of the hill, came in view of <placeName>Glenriddin</placeName> and the mountains at the

     to assemble for worship. There are now no traces from which you could infer for what use the building had been erected: the loose stones and the few which yet continue piled up 
     resemble those which lie</p>

    <p>elsewhere on the mountain; but the shape of the building having been oblong, its remains differ from those of a common sheepfold ; and it has stood east and west. Scarcely did the 
     <trait type="ethnicity"><label>Druids</label></trait>, when they fled to these fastnesses perform their rites in any situation more exposed to disturbance from the elements. One cannot pass by without being reminded that the rustic
     psalmody must have had the accompaniment of many a wildly-whistling blast; and what dismal storms must have often drowned the voice of the preacher! As we decend, <placeName>Patterdale</placeName> opens upon
     the eye in grand simplicity, screened by mountains, and proceeding from two heads, <placeName>Deepdale</placeName> and <placeName>Hartshope</placeName>, where lies the little lake of <placeName>Brotherswater</placeName>, named in old maps <placeName>Broaderwater</placeName>,
     and probably rightly so; for <placeName>Bassenthwaite-mere</placeName> at this day, is familiarly called <placeName>Broadwater</placeName>; but the change in the appellation of this small lake or pool (if it be a corruption) may 
     have been assisted by some melancholy accident similar to what happened about twenty years ago, when two brothers were drowned there, having gone out to take their holiday pleasure
     upon the ice on a new-years day.</p>
    <p rend='indent'> A rough and precipitous peat track brought us down to our friends house.â€” Another fine moonlight night; but a thick fog rising from the neighbouring river, enveloped the
     rocky and wood-crested knoll on which our fancy- cottage had been erected; and, under the damp cast upon my feelings, I consoled myself with</p>

    <p>moralising on the folly of hasty decisions in matters of importance, and the necessity of having at least one years knowledge of a place before you realise airy suggestions in solid
     stone.</p>
    <p rend='indent'>   <date>Saturday, November 10th</date>. At the breakfast table tidings reached us of the death of <persName>Lord Nelson</persName>, and of the victory at <placeName>Trafalgar</placeName>. Sequestered as we were from the
     sympathy of a crowd, we were shocked to hear that the hells had been ringing joyously at <placeName>Penrith</placeName> to celebrate the triumph. In the rebellion of the year 171st, people fled with their
     valuables from the open country to <placeName>Patterdale</placeName>, as a place of refuge secure from the incursions of strangers. At that time, news such as we had heard might have been long in penetrating
     so far into the recesses of the mountains; but now, as you know, the approach is easy, and the communication, in summer time, almost hourly : nor is this strange, for <roleName>travellers</roleName> after
     pleasure are become not less active, and more numerous than those who formerly left their homes for purposes of gain. The <roleName>priest</roleName> on the banks of the remotest stream of Lapland will 
     talk familiarly of <persName>Buonapartes</persName> last conquests, and discuss the progress of the <trait type="ethnicity"><label>French</label></trait> revolution, having acquired much of his information from adventurers impelled by curiosity alone.</p>
    <p rend='indent'>   The morning was clear and cheerful after a night of sharp frost. At <time>10 oclock</time> we took our way on foot towards <placeName>Pooley Bridge</placeName>, on the same side of the lake we had 
     coasted in a boat</p>

    <p>EXCURSION ON THE BANKS</p>
    <p>the day before. â€”Looked backwards to the south from our favourite station above <placeName>Blowick</placeName>. The dazzling sunbeams striking upon the church and village, while the earth was steaming with
     exhalations not traceable in other quarters, rendered their forms even more indistinct than the partial and flitting veil of unillumined vapour had done two days before. The grass on
     which we trod, and the trees in every thicket were dripping with melted hoarfrost. We observed the lemon* coloured leaves of the birches, as the breeze turned them to the sun, sparkle,
     or rather <emph>flash</emph>, like diamonds, and the leafless purple twigs were tipped with globes of shining crystal.</p>
    <p rend='indent'>   The day continued delightful, and unclouded to the end. I will not describe the country which we slowly travelled through, nor relate our adventures : and will only
     add, that on the afternoon of the <date>13th</date> we returned along the banks of <placeName>Ullswater</placeName> by the usual road. The lake lay in deep repose after the agitations of a wet and stormy morning. The 
     trees in <placeName>Gow-barrow park</placeName> were in that state when what is gained by the disclosure of their barls and branches compensates, almost, for the loss of foliage, exhibiting the variety 
     which characterises the point of time between autumn and winter. The hawthorns were leafless; their round heads covered with rich green berries, and adorned with arches of green 
     brambles, and eglantines hung with glossy hips ; and the grey trunks of some of the ancient oaks, which</p>

    <p>in the summer season might have been regarded only for their venerable majesty, now attracted notice by a pretty embellishment of green mosses and fern intermixed with russet leaves 
     retained by those slender outstarting twigs which the veteran tree would not have tolerated in his strength. The smooth silver branches of the ashes were bare ; most of the alders as
     green as the <placeName>Devonshire</placeName> cottage-myrtle that weathers the snows of Christmas.â€” Will you accept it as some apology for my having dwelt so long 011 the woodland ornaments of these scenesâ€”
     that artists speak of the trees on the banks of <placeName>Ullswater</placeName>, and especially along the hays of <placeName>Stybarrowcrags</placeName>, as having a peculiar character of picturesque intricacy in their stems and
     branches, which their rocky stations and the mountain winds have combined to give them.</p>
    <p rend='indent'>   At the end of <placeName>Gowbarrow park</placeName> a large herd of deer were either moving slowly or standing still among the fern. I was sorry when a chance-companion, who had joined us 
     by the way, startled them with a whistle, disturbing an image of grave simplicity and thoughtful enjoyment; for I could have fancied that those natives of this wild and beautiful 
     region were partaking with us a sensation of the solemnity of the closing day. The sun had been set some time ; and we could perceive that the light was fading away from the coves
     of <placeName>Helvellyn</placeName>, but the lake under a luminous sky, was more brilliant than before.</p>
    <p rend='indent'>   After tea at <placeName>Patterdale</placeName>, set out again:â€”</p>

    <p>ODE.</p>
    <p>a fine evening; the seven stars close to the mountain-top; all the stars seemed brighter than usual. The steeps were reflected in <placeName>Brotherswater</placeName>, and, above the lake, appeared like
     enormous black perpendicular walls. The <placeName>Kirkstone</placeName> torrents had been swoln by the rains, and now filled the mountain pass with their roaring, which added greatly to the solemnity of our
     walk. Behind us, when we had climbed to a great height, we saw one light, very distinct, in the vale, like a large red starâ€” a solitary one in the gloomy region. The cheerfulness of
     the scene was in the sky above us.</p>

    <p rend='indent'>The ANNALS OF KENDAL, being a Historical Account of Kendal and its Environs, with Biographical Sketches of many eminent Personages connected with the Town.</p>
    <p rend='center'>BY CORNELIUS NICHOLSON.</p>
   
    <p rend='indent'>CRITICAL NOTICES OP THE WORK.</p>
  
    <p rend='indent'>   &quot;In our last week's Herald, we announced the publication of  The Annals of Kendal:â€” we shall this week present our readers with a specimen of the work, which
     has afforded us considerable amusement and information. There is this striking difference between the production before us, and publications of a similar nature; that, whilst for the
     most part, local histories are interesting to a few only, Mr. Nicholson's volume is admirably calculated to gratify and instruct a more extended sphere."â€”</p><bibl><emph>Lancaster Herald</emph>.</bibl>
    <p rend='indent'>   &quot; Though we have not room for any extracts, we have had, since we received the volume, time to give it a careful perusal, and have no hesitation in saying that
     it docs the highest honour to the talent and industry of the <roleName>Author</roleName> It deduces the history of the district in which Kendal is situated from the earliest era recorded by authentic
     historians, and brings it down to the present moment. The Roman Antiquities are illustrated by numerous engravings, the history of the middle ages by accurate genealogical sketches,
     and the history of a later period by a fund of original or carefully selected information.â€”</p><bibl><emph>Whitehaven Herald.</emph></bibl>
    <p rend='indent'>    The work displays considerable antiquarian research, the original portions are well written, and so much taste and judgment are displayed in the extracts that it is 
     sure of a hearty welcome from all who wish to be well informed respecting the unliquitics and general history of their native town.â€”</p><bibl><emph>Cumberland Pacquet.</emph></bibl>
    <p rend='indent'>   &quot; We need scarcely say how cordially we welcome the work before us* The Annals of Kendalthe annals of a place possessing the highest claims to commemoration; 
     and one connected, too, with our town by all the ties of neighbourhood, of intercourse, and of general interest. * * * * *</p> <!--rb continues below-->
    <p rend='indent'>    Such [after lengthy extracts] is a cursory glance of  The Annals of Kendal,'sufficient, we trust, to show, that the subject abounds with interest, and that it is
     treated of in u manner which reflects great credit upon the author.â€”</p><bibl><emph>Carlisle Patriot</emph></bibl>
    <p rend='indent'>    Mr. Nicholson's work evinces considerable industry and research, and not only possesses many attractions for the historical enquirer and antiquary, but also much
     that is interesting to the general reader. His volume ought to be in the possession of every Northern Tourist.&quot;â€”</p><bibl><emph>Manchester Times.</emph></bibl>
