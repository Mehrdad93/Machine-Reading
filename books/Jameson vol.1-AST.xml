         <head>Preface</head>
         <p>In venturing to place before the public these <q>“fragments”</q> of a journal addressed to a friend,
            I cannot but feel considerable misgiving as to the reception such a work is likely to meet with, 
            particularly at this time, when the country to which it partly refers is the subject of so much 
            difference of opinion and so much animosity of feeling. This little book, 
            the mere result of much thoughtful idleness and many an idle thought,
            has grown up insensibly out of an accidental promise. It never was intended to go before the world
            in its present crude and desultory form; and I am too sensible of its many deficiencies,
            not to feel that some explanation is due to that public, which has hitherto regarded my
            attempts in literature with so much forbearance and kindness.</p> 
         <p>While in <placeName>Canada</placeName> I was thrown into scenes and regions
            hitherto undescribed by any <roleName>traveller,</roleName>
            (for the northern shores of <placeName>Lake Huron</placeName> are almost new ground,)
            and into relations with <trait type="race"><label>Indian tribes,</label></trait>
            <pb n="4"/><seg type="pagenumber">iv</seg>such as few <trait type="race"><label>European women</label></trait>
            of refined and civilized habits have ever risked,
            and none have recorded. My intention was to have given the result of what I had seen,
            and the reflections and comparisons excited by so much novel experience,
            in quite a different form—and one less obtrusive; but owing to the intervention of various circumstances,
            and occupation of grave import, I found myself reduced to the alternative of
            either publishing the book as it now stands, or of suppressing it altogether. 
            Neither the time nor the attention necessary to remodel the whole were within my own power.
            In preparing these notes for the press, much has been omitted of a personal nature,
            but far too much of such irrelevant matter still remains; far too much which may expose me 
            to misapprehension, if not even to severe criticism; but now, as heretofore,
            I throw myself upon <q>“the merciful construction of good women,”</q> wishing it to be understood
            that this little book, such as it is, is more particularly addressed to my own sex. 
            I would fain have extracted, altogether, the impertinent leaven of egotism which necessarily 
            mixed itself up with the journal form of writing; but in making the attempt, 
            the whole work lost its original character—lost its air of reality, 
            lost even its essential truth, and whatever it might possess of the grace of ease and pic-
            <pb n ="5"/><seg type="pagenumber">v</seg>torical animation: it became flat, heavy, didactic.
            It was found that to extract the tone of personal feeling,
            on which the whole series of action and observation depended, 
            was like drawing the thread out of a string of beads—the chain of linked ideas
            and experiences fell to pieces, and became a mere unconnected, incongruous heap.
            I have been obliged to leave the flimsy thread of sentiment to sustain the facts
            and observations loosely strung together; feeling strongly to what it may expose me,
            but having deliberately chosen the alternative, prepared, of course, to endure what
            I may appear to have defied; though, in truth, defiance and assurance are both far from me.</p> 
         <p>These notes were written in <placeName>Upper Canada,</placeName> but it will be seen that
            they have little reference to the politics or statistics of that unhappy and mismanaged,
            but most magnificent country. Subsequently I made a short tour through <placeName>Lower Canada,</placeName>
            just before the breaking out of the late revolts. <persName>Sir John Colborne,</persName>
            whose mind appeared to me cast in the antique mould of chivalrous honor,
            and whom I never heard mentioned in either province but with respect and veneration,
            was then occupied in preparing against the exigency which he afterwards met so effectively.
            I saw of course something of the state of feeling on both sides, but not enough
            <pb n="6"/><seg type="pagenumber">vi</seg>to venture a word on the subject. <placeName>Upper Canada</placeName> appeared to me loyal in spirit,
            but resentful and repining under the sense of injury, and suffering from the
            total absence of all sympathy on the part of the
            <trait type="ethnicity"><label>English government</label></trait> with 
            the condition, the wants, the feelings, the capabilities of the people and country.
            I do not mean to say that this want of sympathy <hi rend="italics">now</hi> exists to the same extent as formerly;
            it has been abruptly and painfully awakened, but it has too long existed.
            In climate, in soil, in natural productions of every kind, the upper province
            appeared to me superior to the lower province, and well calculated to become
            the inexhaustible timber-yard and granary of the mother country. 
            The want of a sea-port, the want of security of property, the general mismanagement
            of the government lands—these seemed to me the most prominent causes of 
            the physical depression of this splendid country, while the poverty and deficient
            education of the people, and a plentiful lack of public spirit in those
            who were not of the people, seemed sufficiently to account for the moral 
            depression every where visible. Add a system of mistakes and mal-administration
            not chargeable to any one individual, or any one measure, but to the whole
            tendency of our colonial government; the perpetual change of <roleName>officials</roleName> and
            change of measures; the 
            <pb n="7"/><seg type="pagenumber">vii</seg>fluctuation of principles destroying all public confidence,
            and a degree of ignorance relative to the country itself, not credible
            except to those who may have visited it; add these three things together,
            the want of knowledge, the want of judgement, the want of sympathy, on
            the part of the government, how can we be surprised at the strangely anomalous
            condition of the governed?—that of a land absolutely teeming with the richest
            capabilities, yet poor in population, in wealth, and in energy! But I feel
            I am getting beyond my depth. Let us hope that the reign of our <roleName>young Queen</roleName>
            will not begin, like that of <persName>Maria Theresa,</persName> with the loss of one of her 
            fairest provinces; and that hereafter she may look upon the map of her
            dominions without the indignant blushes and tears which <persName>Maria Theresa,</persName> 
            to the last moment of her life, contemplated the map of her dismembered 
            empire and regretted her lost <placeName>Silesia.</placeName></p>
         <p>I have abstained generally from politics and personalities; 
            from the former, because such discussions are foreign to my turn of mind
            and above my capacity, and from the latter on principle; and I wish it to
            be distinctly understood, that whenever I <hi rend="italics">have</hi> introduced any personal details,
            it has been with the express sanction of those most interested; 
            I allude particularly to the account of <roleName>Colonel <persName>Tal-
            <pb n="8"/><seg type="pagenumber">viii</seg>bot</persName></roleName> and the family at the <placeName>Sault Ste. Marie.</placeName>
            For the rest, I have only to add, that on no subject do I
            wish to dictate an opinion, or assume to speak as one having authority;
            my utmost ambition extends no farther than to <hi rend="italics">suggest</hi> matter for inquiry
            and reflection. If this little book contains mistakes, they will be chastised
            and corrected, and I shall be glad of it: if it contain but one truth,
            and that no bigger than a grain of mustard-seed, it will not have been 
            cast into the world in vain, nor will any severity of criticism make me, 
            in such a case, repent of having published it, even in its present undigested,
            and, I am afraid, unsatisfactory form.</p>

<p><date when="1836-12-20">Dec. 20th</date>.</p>
         <p><placeName>Toronto</placeName>—such is 
            now the sonorous name of this our sublime capital—was, <date when="1806">thirty years ago</date>, 
            a wilderness, the haunt of 
the bear and deer, with a little, ugly, inefficient fort, which, however, could not be more ugly or 
inefficient than the present one. <date when="1826">Ten years ago</date> <placeName>Toronto</placeName> 
            was a village, with one brick house and four or 
            five hundred <roleName>inhabitants</roleName>; <date when="1831">five years ago</date> it became a city, containing about five thousand <roleName>inhabitants</roleName>, 
            and then bore the name of <placeName>Little York</placeName>; now it is <placeName>Toronto</placeName>, with an increasing trade, and a population of
ten thousand people. So far I write as per book.</p> 
         <p>What <placeName>Toronto</placeName> may be in summer, I cannot tell; they say
            it is a pretty place. At present its appearance to me, a stranger, is most strangely mean and melancholy. 
A little ill-built town on low land, at the bottom of a frozen bay, with one very ugly church, without 
tower or steeple; some government offices, built of staring red brick, in the most tasteless, vulgar 
style imaginable; three feet of snow 
<pb n="12"/><seg type="pagenumber">10</seg>all around; and the gray, sullen, wintry lake, and the dark gloom 
            of the pine forest bounding the prospect; such seems <placeName>Toronto</placeName> to me now. I did not expect much ; but 
for this I was not prepared. Perhaps no preparation could have prepared me, or softened my present feelings. 
I will not be unjust if I can help it, nor querulous. If I look into my own heart, I find that it is regret 
for what I have left and lost—the absent, not the present—which throws over all around me a chill, 
colder than that of the wintry day—a gloom, deeper than that of the wintry night.</p> 
<p>This is all very dismal, 
very weak, perhaps; but I know no better way of coming at the truth, than by observing and recording 
faithfully the impressions made by objects and characters on my own mind—or, rather, the impress they 
receive from my own mind—shadowed by the clouds which pass over its horizon, taking each tincture of its 
varying mood—until they emerge into light, to be corrected, or at least modified, by observation and 
comparison. Neither do I know any better way than this of conveying to the mind of another, the truth, 
and nothing but the truth, if not the whole truth. So I shall write on. Hitherto I have not been accused 
of looking on the things of this world through a glass darkly, but rather of a contrary tendency. What have 
I done with my spectacles couleur de rose?—the cheerful faith which sustained me through far worse than 
any thing I can anticipate here;—the desire to know, the impatience to learn, the quick social sympathies, 
the readiness to please and 
   <pb n="13"/><seg type="pagenumber">11</seg>to be pleased—derived, perhaps, from my <trait type="ethnicity"><label>Irish blood</label></trait>, and to which I have owed so much of comfort when I
have most needed it, so much of enjoyment when least I could have hoped for it—what! and are all forgotten, 
all gone? Yet am I not quite an icicle, nor an oyster—I almost wish I were! No, worst of all, is this 
regretful remembrance of friends who loved me, this heart-sick longing after home, and country, and all 
familiar things and dear domestic faces! I am like an uprooted tree, dying at the core, yet with a strange 
unreasonable power at times of mocking at my own most miserable weakness. Going to bed in tears last night, 
after saying my prayers for those far away across that terrible <placeName>Atlantic</placeName>, an odd remembrance flashed across 
   me of that <persName>Madame de Bouffiers</persName>, who declared <q>"avec tant de sérieux et de sentiment,"</q> that she would consent 
   to go as <roleName>ambassadress</roleName> to <placeName>England</placeName>, only on the condition of taking with her <q>"vingt-cinq ou vingt-six de ses 
   <roleName>amis intimes</roleName>,"</q> and sixty or eighty <roleName>persons</roleName> who were absolument necessaires à son bonheur. The image of graceful 
impertinence thus conjured up, made me smile—but am I so unlike her in this fit of unreason? Every where 
there is occupation for the rational and healthy intellect, every where good to be done, duties to be 
performed—every where the mind is, or should be, its own world, its own country, its own home at least. 
How many fine things I could say or quote, in prose or in rhyme, on this subject! But in vain I conjure up 
Philosophy, <q>"she will not come when I do call for her;"</q> but in her stead come thronging sad and sorrowful 
<pb n="14"/><seg type="pagenumber">12</seg>recollections, and shivering sensations, all telling me that I am a stranger among strangers, miserable inwardly 
and outwardly—and that the thermometer is twelve degrees below zero!</p> 
         <p>There is much, too, in first impressions, 
            and as yet I have not recovered from the pain and annoyance of my outset here. My friends at <placeName>New-York</placeName> expended 
            much eloquence—eloquence wasted in vain!—in endeavouring to dissuade me from a winter journey to <placeName>Canada</placeName>. I 
listened, and was grateful for their solicitude, but must own I did not credit the picture they drew of the 
difficulties and désagrémens I was destined to meet by the way. I had chosen, they said, (Heaven knows I did 
not choose it,) the very worst season for a journey through the <placeName>state of New-York</placeName>; the usual facilities for 
travelling were now suspended; a few weeks sooner the rivers and canals had been open; a few weeks later 
the roads, smoothed up with snow, had been in sleighing order; now, the navigation was frozen, and the roads 
so broken up as to be nearly impassable. Then there was only a night boat on the <placeName>Hudson</placeName>, <q>"to proceed,"</q> as 
            the printed paper set forth, <q>"to <placeName>Albany</placeName>, or as far as the ice permitted."</q> All this, and more, were represented 
to me—and with so much apparent reason and real feeling, and in words and tones so difficult to resist! But 
though I could appreciate the kindness of those persuasive words, they brought no definite idea to my mind; 
I could form no notion of difficulties which by fair words, presence of mind, and money in my pocket, could not 
be obviated. I had travelled half over
            <pb n="15"/><seg type="pagenumber">13</seg>the continent of <placeName>Europe</placeName>, often alone, and had never yet been in circumstances where these availed not. In my 
ignorance I could conceive none; but I would not lightly counsel a similar journey to any one—certainly 
not to a woman.</p>
         <p>As we ascended the <placeName>Hudson</placeName> in the night, I lost, of course, the view of that supurb scenery 
which I was assured even winter could not divest of all its beauty—rather clothed it in a different kind of 
beauty. At the very first blush of morning, I escaped from the heated cabin, crowded with <roleName>listless women</roleName> 
            and <roleName>clamorous children</roleName>, and found my way to the deck. I was surprised by a spectacle as beautiful as it was 
            new to me. The <placeName>Сatskill mountains</placeName> which we had left behind us in the night, were still visible, but just melting 
from the view, robed in a misty purple light, while our magnificent steamer—the prow armed with a sharp iron 
sheath for the purpose—was crashing its way through solid ice four inches thick, which seemed to close behind 
us into an adhesive mass, so that the wake of the vessel was not distinguished a few yards from the stern: yet 
in the path thus opened, and only seemingly closed, followed at some little distance a beautiful schooner and 
two smaller steam-vessels. I walked up and down, from the prow to the stern, refreshed by the keen frosty air, 
and the excitement caused by various picturesque effects, on the ice-bound river and the frozen shores, till we 
reached <placeName>Hudson</placeName>. Beyond this town it was not safe for the boat to advance, and we were still thirty miles below 
            <placeName>Albany</placeName>. After leaving <placeName>Hudson</placeName>, (with the exception of the rail-road between <placeName>Albany</placeName>
            <pb n="16"/><seg type="pagenumber">14</seg>and <placeName>Utica</placeName>,) it was all heavy, weary work; the most painfully fatiguing journey I ever remember. Such were the 
roads, that we were once six hours going eleven miles. What was usually a day's journey from one town, or one 
good inn to another, occupied sometimes a day and a night, or even two days.</p> 
         <p>One dark night, I remember, as the 
sleet and rain were falling fast and our Extra was slowly dragged by wretched brutes of horses through what 
seemed to me <q>"sloughs of despond,"</q> some package ill stowed on the roof, which in the <trait type="ethnicity"><label>American stages</label></trait> presents 
            no resting-place either for man or box, fell off. The <roleName>driver</roleName> alighted to fish it out of the mud. As there was 
            some delay, a gentleman seated opposite to me put his head out of the window to inquire the cause; to whom 
            the <roleName>driver</roleName>'s voice replied, in an angry tone, <q>"I say you, <roleName>mister</roleName>, don't you sit jabbering there, but lend a 
            hand to heave these things aboard!"</q> To my surprise, the gentleman did not appear struck by the insolence of this 
            summons, but immediately jumped out and lent his assistance. This is merely the manner of the people; the <roleName>driver</roleName> 
            intended no insolence, nor was it taken as such, and my fellow-<roleName>travellers</roleName> could not help laughing at my surprise.</p> 
<p>After six days and three nights of this travelling, unrelieved by companionship, or interest of any kind, I began 
   to sink with fatigue. The first thing that roused me was our arrival at the ferry of the <placeName>Niagara river</placeName>, at 
   <placeName>Queenston</placeName>, about seven miles below the Falls. It was a dark night, and while our little boat was tossed in the 
eddying waters, and
<pb n="17"/><seg type="pagenumber">15</seg>guided by a light to the opposite shore, we could distinctly hear the deep roar of the cataract, filling, and, 
as it seemed to me, shaking the atmosphere around us. That mighty cataract, the dream and vision of my childhood 
and youth, so near—yet unseen—making itself thus heard and felt—like <persName>Job</persName>'s vision, consciously present, yet 
unrevealed and undiscerned! You may believe that I woke up very decidedly from my lethargy of weariness to 
listen to that mysterious voice, which made my blood pause and thrill. At <placeName>Queenston</placeName> we slept, and proceeded 
   next morning to the town of <placeName>Niagara</placeName> on the shore of <placeName>Lake Ontario</placeName>. Now, as we had heard, the navigation on the 
lake had ceased, and we looked for nothing better than a further journey of one hundred miles round the head 
of the lake, and by the most execrable roads, instead of an easy passage of thirty miles across from shore to 
shore. But Fortune, seized with one of those freaks which, when we meet them in books, we pronounce improbable 
and unnatural, (and she has played me many such, some good, some bad,) had ordered matters otherwise. A 
steam-vessel, making a last trip, had called accidentally at the port, and was just going off; the paddles 
were actually in motion as I and my baggage together were hurried—almost <hi rend="italics">flung</hi>—on board. No sooner there, 
than I threw myself down in the cabin utterly overwhelmed with fatigue, and sank at once into a profound and 
dreamless sleep.</p> 
         <p>How long I slept I knew not: they roused me suddenly to tell me we were at <placeName>Toronto</placeName>, and, not 
            <pb n="18"/><seg type="pagenumber">16</seg> very well able to stand, I hurried on deck. The wharf was utterly deserted, the arrival of 
the steamboat being accidental and unexpected; and as I stepped out of the boat I sank ankle-deep into 
mud and ice. The day was intensely cold and damp; the sky lowered sulkily, laden with snow, which was just 
beginning to fall. Half-blinded by the sleet driven into my face and the tears which filled my eyes, I walked 
about a mile through a quarter of the town mean in appearance, not thickly inhabited, and to me, as yet, an 
unknown wilderness; and through dreary, miry ways, never much thronged, and now, by reason of the impending 
snowstorm, nearly solitary. I heard no voices, no quick foot-steps of men or <roleName type="family">children;</roleName> I met no familiar 
face, no look of welcome. I was sad at heart as a woman could be—and these were the impressions, the feelings, 
with which I entered the house which was to be called my <hi rend="italics">home</hi>! </p>
           <p>There is some need—is there not?—that I allow 
time for these sullen, unkindly influences to melt from my mind and heart before I judge of what I behold around 
me. The house—only a temporary residence while another is building—is ill provided with defences against the 
cold, and altogether comfortless; it has the advantage of commanding one of the principal roads entering the 
town and a glimpse of the bay—but at present all objects wear one hue. Land is not distinguishable from water. 
I see nothing but snow heaped up against my windows, not only without but within; I hear no sound but the 
tinkling of sleigh-bells and the occasional
<pb n="19"/><seg type="pagenumber">17</seg>lowing of a poor half-starved cow, that, standing up to the knees in a snow-drift, presents herself at the door

         <p> <date when="1836-12-27">Dec. 27</date>. With regard to the society, I can as yet say nothing, having seen nothing of it. All the <roleName>official 
            gentlemen</roleName> have called, and all the <roleName>ladies</roleName> have properly and politely left their cards: so <date when="1836-12-26">yesterday</date>, in a 
sleigh, well wrapped up in furs and buffalo robes, I set out duly to return these visits. I learned something 
of the geography of the town—nothing of the people. Those whom I did see, looked somewhat formal and alarmed,
but they may be very excellent people for all that. I returned trembling and shuddering, chilled outwardly and 
inwardly, for none of my fur defences prevailed against the frost and the current of icy air, through which we 
glided, or rather flew, along the smooth road. </p>
         <p>The appearance of the town was much more cheerful than on my first 
landing, but still melancholy enough. There was little movement or animation; few people in the streets; 
some good shops and some brick houses, but the greater number of wood. The very different appearance of the town 
and bay in the summer season, the blueness of the water, the brightness of the verdure, the throng of vessels, 
the busy crowds along the piers, were often described to me, but without conveying to my mind any very definite 
or cheering picture. The very <seg type="pagesignature">2*</seg>
<pb n="20"/><seg type="pagenumber">18</seg>novelty of the scene before me, by strongly impressing my imagination, seemed to shut out all power of 
anticipation.</p> 
         <p>The choice of this site for the capital of the <placeName>Upper Province</placeName> was decided by the fine harbor, 
            the only one between <placeName>Burlington Bay</placeName> and <placeName>Cobourg</placeName>, a distance of about a hundred and fifty miles. <persName>General 
               Simcoe</persName>, the first <roleName>governor</roleName> after the division of the two provinces, and a man of great activity and energy 
of character, entertained the idea of founding a metropolis. At that time the head quarters of the government 
were at <placeName>Niagara</placeName>, then called <placeName>Newark</placeName>, on the opposite shore; but this was too near the frontiers to be a safe 
            position. Nor is <placeName>Toronto</placeName> much safer: from its low situation, and the want of any commanding height in the 
            neighborhood, it is nearly defenceless. In case of a war with <placeName>America</placeName>, a few boats sent from the opposite 
            coast of <placeName>New-York</placeName> could easily lay the fort and town in ashes; and, in fact, during the last war, in <date>1813</date>, 
such was the fate of both. But the same reasons which rendered the place indefensible to us, rendered it 
untenable for the enemy, and it was immediately evacuated. Another objection was, and is, the unhealthiness 
of its situation,—in a low swamp not yet wholly drained, and with large portions of uncleared land 
immediately round it: still the beauty and safety of the spacious harbor, and its central position about 
halfway between <placeName>Lake Huron</placeName> and the frontier line of <placeName>Lower Canada</placeName>, have fixed its rank as capital of the 
            province and the seat of the legislature. </p>
         <p>When the <roleName>engineer</roleName>, <persName>Bouchette</persName>, was sent by
            <pb n="21"/><seg type="pagenumber">19</seg> <persName>General Simcoe</persName> to survey the site, (in <date>1793</date>,) it was a mere swamp, a tangled wilderness; the birch, the 
hemlock and the tamarac-trees were growing down to the water's edge, and even into the lake. I have been 
told that <placeName>Toronto</placeName>, the <trait type="race"><label>Indian appellation</label></trait> of the whole district, signifies <hi rend="italics"> trees growing out of water</hi>. 
            <persName>Colonel Bouchette</persName> says, that at this time the only vestige of humanity for a hundred miles on every side, 
            was one solitary wigwam on the shore, the dwelling of a few <trait type="ethnicity"><label>Missassagua Indians</label></trait>. <date when="1796">Three years afterwards</date>, 
            when the <persName>Duc de Rochefoucauld</persName> was here, the infant metropolis consisted of a fort and twelve miserable 
            log huts, the inhabitants of which, as the <roleName>duke</roleName> tells us, bore no good reputation. The town was, however, 
already marked out in streets running parallel with the shore of the bay for about two miles, and crossed 
by others at right angles. It is a pity that while they were about it, they did not follow the example of 
the <trait type="ethnicity"><label>Americans</label></trait>, in such cases, and make the principal streets of ample width; some hundred feet, or even 
furlongs, more or less, would have made little difference where the wild unowned forest extended, for all 
they knew, from the lake to the north pole—<hi rend="italics">now</hi>, it would be so easy to amend the error. <placeName>Kingstreet</placeName>, 
the principal street, looks narrow, and will look narrower when the houses are higher, better, and more 
regularly built. I perceive that in laying out the <hi rend="italics">fashionable</hi> or <placeName>west-end of the city</placeName>, they have avoided 
            the same mistake. A wide space between the building lots and <placeName>Lake Ontario</placeName> has been reserved very properly 
as a road or esplanade,
<pb n="22"/><seg type="pagenumber">20</seg>but I doubt whether even this be wide enough. One of the most curious and inexplicable phenomena 
connected with these immense inland seas is the gradual rise of the waters; and even within these 
few years, as I am informed, great part of the high bank has been washed away, and a carriage-road at the 
foot of it along the shore has been wholly covered. If this process goes on, and at the same rate, there 
must be a solid embankment, or quay, raised as a barrier against the encroaching waters, or the esplanade 
itself will in time disappear.</p>
         <p> Thus much of knowledge I gained in the course of my cold drive—bitter 
cold it was every way, and I returned without being much comforted or edified by my visits.</p>
         <!-- horizontal line --><p><date when="1837-01-01">New Year's Day</date>—colder than ever. This morning the thermometer stood at eighteen degrees below zero, 
            and <persName>Dr. R ---</persName> told me that some chemical compounds in his laboratory had frozen in the night, and 
burst the phials in which they were contained.</p>
         <p> They have here at <placeName>Toronto</placeName> the custom which prevails 
            in <placeName>France</placeName>, <placeName>Germany</placeName>, the <placeName>United States</placeName>, (more or less every where, I believe, but in <placeName>England</placeName>,) of paying 
visits of congratulation on the first day of the year. This custom, which does not apparently harmonize
with the manners of the people, has been borrowed from the <trait type="ethnicity"><label>French inhabitants</label></trait> of <placeName>Lower Canada</placeName>.</p>
            <p>I received about thirty gentlemen—
<pb n="23"/><seg type="pagenumber">21</seg>to gentlemen luckily for me the obligation is confined—two thirds of whom I had never seen nor heard 
of before, nor was there any one to introduce them. Some of them, on being ushered into the room, bowed, 
sat down, and after the lapse of two minutes, rose and bowed themselves out of the room again without 
uttering a syllable; all were too much in a hurry and apparently far too cold to converse. Those who 
did speak, complained, sensibly enough, of the unmeaning duty imposed on them, and the danger incurred 
by running in and out from the over-heated rooms into the fierce biting air, and prophesied to themselves 
and others sore throats, and agues, and fevers, and every ill that flesh is heir to. I could but believe 
and condole. These strange faces appeared and disappeared in succession so rapidly, that I was almost 
giddy, but there were one or two among the number, whom even in five minutes' conversation I distinguished 
at once as superior to the rest, and original minded, thinking men.</p> 
         <p>In <trait type="ethnicity"><label>London society</label></trait> I met with many men 
            whose real material of mind it was difficult to discover—either they had been smoothed and polished down 
by society, or education had overlaid their understanding with stuccoed ornaments, and figures historical 
and poetical—very pretty to look at—but the coarse brick-work or the rotten lath and plaster lay underneath; 
there being in this new country far less of conventional manner, it was so much the easier to tell at once 
the brick from the granite and the marble.</p>

            for the present, from local circumstances, an exception. The winter in the <placeName>upper province</placeName> is infinitely 
            less severe and trying than the same season in <placeName>Lower Canada</placeName>.</p> <!--horizontal line-->
         <p><date when="1837-01-14">Jan. 14.</date></p> <p>It should seem that this wintry 
            season, which appears to me so dismal, is for the <trait type="ethnicity"><label>Canadians</label></trait> the season of festivity, and if I were not 
sick and a stranger—if I had friends near me, I should really enjoy it. Now is the time for visiting, 
for sleighing excursions, for all intercourse of business and friendship, for balls in town, and dances 
in farm-houses, and courtships and marriages, and prayer-meetings and assignations of all sorts. In 
summer, the heat and the mosquitos render travelling disagreeable at best; in spring the roads are 
absolutely impassable; in autumn there is too much agricultural occupation; but in winter the forests 
are pervious; the roads present a smooth surface of dazzling snow; the <roleName>settlers</roleName> in the woods drive into 
the towns, supply themselves with stores and clothing, and fresh meat,
<pb n="25"/><seg type="pagenumber">23</seg>the latter a luxury which they can seldom obtain in the summer. I stood at my window to-day watching 
the sleighs as they glided past. They are of all shapes and sizes. A few of the carriage-sleighs are 
well appointed and handsome. The market-sleighs are often two or three boards nailed together in form 
of a wooden box upon runners; some straw and a buffalo skin or blanket serve for the seat; barrels 
of flour and baskets of eggs fill up the empty space. Others are like cars, and others, called <hi rend="italics">cutters</hi>, 
            are mounted on high runners, like sleigh phaetons; these are sported by the young men and <roleName>officers 
               of the garrison</roleName>, and require no inconsiderable skill in driving; however, aş I am assured, they are 
overturned in the snow not above once in a quarter of an hour, and no harm and much mirth ensues; but 
the wood sleighs are my delight: a large platform of boards is raised upon runners, with a few upright 
poles held together at top by a rope, the logs of oak, pine, and maple, are then heaped up to the height 
of six or seven feet. On the summit lie a couple of deer frozen stiff, their huge antlers projecting 
in a most picturesque fashion, and on these again, a man is seated with a blanket round him, his furred 
cap drawn down upon his ears, and his scarlet woollen comforter forming a fine bit of color. He guides 
with a pole his two patient oxen, the clouds of vapor curling from their nostrils into the keen frosty 
air—the whole machine, in short, as wildly picturesque as the grape wagons in Italy, though, to be sure, 
the associations are somewhat different.</p>
         <pb n="26"/><p><seg type="pagenumber">24</seg></p><p><date when="1837-01-16">Jan. 16.</date></p> <p>This morning, before I was quite dressed, a singular visit was announced. I had expressed to 
            my friend <persName>Mr. Hepburne</persName> a wish to see some of the <trait type="ethnicity"><label>aborigines</label></trait> of the country; he had the kindness to 
            remember my request, and <persName>Colonel Givins</persName>, the <roleName>principal Indian agent</roleName>, had accordingly brought some 
            <trait type="race"><label>Indians</label></trait> to visit us. Those to whom the appearance of these people is familiar and by no means interesting, 
            were surprised by a curiosity which you will at least allow was very natural and <!-- Gender --><hi rend="italics"> feminine</hi>.</p> 
         <p>The party 
            consisted of three—a <roleName>chief</roleName> named the <persName>White Deer</persName>, and two of his friends. The <roleName>chief</roleName> wore a blanket coat, 
and leggings, and a blanket hood with apeak from which depended a long black eagle plume; stout mocazins 
or shoes of undressed deer-skin completed his attire; he had about fifty strings of blue wampum round 
his neck. The other two were similarly dressed, with the exception of the wampum and the feathers. Before 
I went down I had thrown a chain of wampum round my neck, which seemed to please them. Chairs being 
presented, they sat down at once, (though, as <persName>Colonel Givins</persName> said, they would certainly have preferred 
the floor,) and answered with a grave and quiet dignity the compliments and questions addressed to them. 
Their deportment was taciturn and self-possessed, and their countenances melancholy; that of the <roleName>chief</roleName> 
            was by far the most intelligent. They informed me that they were <trait type="ethnicity"><label>Chippewas</label></trait> from the neighborhood of <placeName>Lake 
               Huron</placeName>; that the hunting season had been unsuccessful; that their tribe was suffering the 
            <pb n="27"/><seg type="pagenumber">25</seg>extremìty of hunger and cold; and that they had come to beg from their Great Father the <roleName>Governor</roleName> rations 
of food, and a supply of blankets for their women and <roleName type="family">children.</roleName> They had walked over the snow, in their 
snow-shoes, from the lake, one hundred and eighty miles, and for the last forty-eight hours none of them 
had tasted food. A breakfast of cold meat, bread, and beer, was immediately ordered for them; and though 
they had certainly never beheld in their lives the arrangement of an <trait type="ethnicity"><label>European table</label></trait>, and were besides 
half famished, they sat down with unembarrassed tranquillity, and helped themselves to what they wished, 
with the utmost propriety—only, after one or two trials, using their own knives and fingers in preference 
to the table knife and fork. After they had eaten and drunk sufficiently, they were conducted to the 
            <placeName>government-house</placeName> to receive from the <roleName>governor</roleName> presents of blankets, rifles, and provisions, and each, 
            on parting, held out his hand to me, and the <roleName>chief</roleName>, with a grave earnestness, prayed for the blessing 
of the Great Spirit on me and my house. On the whole, the impression they left, though amusing and exciting 
from its mere novelty, was melancholy. The sort of desperate resignation in their swarthy countenances,
their squalid, dingy habiliments, and their forlorn story, filled me with pity, and, I may add, 
disappointment; and all my previous impressions of the <roleName type="family">independent children</roleName> of the forest are for the 
present disturbed. </p>
         <p>These are the first specimens I have seen of that <trait type="ethnicity"><label>fated race</label></trait>, with which I hope to 
            become better acquainted before I leave the country.<seg type="pagesignature"> VOL. i. 3</seg>
            <pb n="28"/><seg type="pagenumber">26</seg>Notwithstanding all I have heard and read, I have yet but a vague idea of the <trait type="race"><label>Indian character</label></trait>; and the very

adds to the difficulty of forming a correct estimate of the people, and more particularly of the true 
position of their women. <persName>Colonel Givins</persName>, who has passed thirty years of his life among the <trait type="ethnicity"><label>northwest

            between the customs and language of different nations, the <trait type="ethnicity"><label>Chippewas</label></trait> and <trait type="ethnicity"><label>Mohawks</label></trait>, for instance, 
            as there is between any two nations of <placeName>Europe</placeName>.</p> <!-- horizontal line -->
         <p><date when="1837-01-16">January 16.</date></p> <p>Some <roleName>philosopher</roleName> has said or written, that our good and bad qualities, our virtues and our 
            vices, depend more on the influence of climate, than the pride of <trait type="race"><label>civilized</label></trait> humanity would be willing 
to allow; and this is a truth or truism, which for my own part I cannot gainsay—yet which I do not 
much like to believe. Whatever may be the climate in which the human being is born or reared, can he 
not always by moral strength raise himself above its degrading, or benumbing, or exciting influence? 
and yet more, rather than less, easily, when, at a mature age and with habits formed, he is subjected 
accidentally to such influences? Is
<pb n="29"/><seg type="pagenumber">27</seg>there most wisdom, in such a case, in passively assimilating ourselves, our habits, and our feelings, 
to external circumstances, or resisting and combating them, rather to defend the integrity of our own 
individual being, than with the hope of changing or controlling the physical or social influences 
around us? </p>
<p>How I might have settled this question with myself, long ago, when in possession of the 
health and energy and trusting spirit of my young years, I know—but now it is too late. I could almost 
wish myself a dormouse, or a she-bear, to sleep away the rest of this cold, cold winter, and wake only 
with the first green leaves, the first warm breath of the summer wind. I shiver through the day and 
through the night; and, like poor <persName>Harry Gill</persName>, <q>"my teeth they chatter, chatter still;"</q> and then at 
   intervals I am burned up with a dry hot fever: this is what my <roleName>maid</roleName>, a good little <trait type="ethnicity"><label>Oxfordshire girl</label></trait>, 
   calls the <hi rend="italics"> hager</hi>, (the ague,) more properly the lake fever, or cold fever. From the particular situation 
   of <placeName>Toronto</placeName>, the disorder is very prevalent here in the spring: being a stranger, and not yet <hi rend="italics">acclimatée</hi>, 
it has attacked me thus unseasonably. Bark is the general and unfailing remedy.</p> 
<p>The cold is at this 
time so intense, that the ink freezes while I write, and my fingers stiffen round the pen; a glass 
of water by my bed-side, within a few feet of the hearth, (heaped with logs of oak and maple kept 
burning all night long,) is a solid mass of ice in the morning. God help the poor <roleName>emigrants</roleName> who are 
yet unprepared against the rigor of the
   <pb n="30"/><seg type="pagenumber">28</seg>season!—yet this is nothing to the climate of the <placeName>lower province</placeName>, where, as we hear, the thermometer 
has been thirty degrees below zero. I lose all heart to write home, or to register a reflection or a 
feeling;—thought stagnates in my head as the ink in my pen—and this will never do!—I <hi rend="italics"> must</hi> rouse 
myself to occupation; and if I cannot find it without, I must create it from within. There are yet 
four months of winter and leisure to be disposed of. How?—I know not; but they <hi rend="italics"> must</hi> be employed,

         <!-- horizontal line --><p>The <!-- Not sure if this is a roleName or placeName --><orgName>house of assembly</orgName> is now sitting, 
            and the question at present agitated is the appropriation of the 
            <orgName><orgName>clergy</orgName></orgName> reserves—a question momentous to the future welfare of the colony, and interesting to every 
thinking mind. There are great differences of opinion, and a good deal of bitterness of spirit, 
prevailing on this subject, so often brought under discussion, and as yet unsettled. When <placeName>Upper 
   Canada</placeName> was separated from the <placeName>Lower Province</placeName> (in <date>1791</date>) one-seventh part of the lands was set apart 
            for the maintenance of the <orgName>clergy</orgName>, under the name of <orgName>clergy</orgName> Reserves; and the <trait type="religion"><label>Church of England</label></trait>, 
as being the church by law established, claimed the entire appropriation of these lands. The 
            <trait type="religion"><label>Roman Catholics</label></trait>, under the old conditions by which the maintenance of their church was provided 
for on the conquest of the colony, also put in their claim, as did the <trait type="religion"><label>Presbyterians</label></trait> on account 
of their influence, and the <trait type="religion"><label>Methodists</label></trait> on account of their 
            <pb n="31"/><seg type="pagenumber">29</seg>number. The <roleName>inhabitants</roleName>, mean time, through the legislature, petitioned the government that the 
whole of the <orgName>clergy</orgName> reserves should be appropriated to the purposes of education, for which the 
funds already provided are wholly inadequate, and are ill managed besides—but of this hereafter. 
If the question had been left to be settled by the <orgName>house of assembly</orgName> then sitting, the 
<orgName>Radicals</orgName> of <date>1832</date>, there is no doubt that such would have been the destination of these reserves, 
which now consist of about two millions of acres out of fourteen millions, settled or in course 
of cultivation, and indefinitely increasing as more and more land is redeemed from the unmeasured, 
interminable forest. The government at home sent over to the legislature here a cession of the 
crown lands, and a recommendation to settle the whole question; but we have now a House of 
Assembly differently constituted from that of <date>1832</date>, and the preponderance is altogether the 
other way. I am now aware that there exist three parties on this subject;</p> 
         <p>First, those who would 
appropriate the whole of these reserves solely to the maintenance of the <trait type="religion"><label>Church of England</label></trait>. This 
is a small but zealous party—not so much insisting on their own claim, as on the absolute inconsistency 
and unrighteousness of allowing any other claim. The <trait type="religion"><label>Church of England</label></trait>, as the <roleName>archdeacon</roleName> observed 
last night, being the only true church, as well as the church by law established, to maintain any other 
religion or form of religion, at the expense of the state, is a manifest rebellion against both the 
            <hi rend="italics"> gospel</hi> and the <hi rend="italics"> law</hi>. </p><p><seg type="pagesignature"> 3*</seg></p>
         <pb n="32"/><p><seg type="pagenumber">30</seg></p><p>A second party represent that the <trait type="religion"><label>Church of England</label></trait> consists of but a small number of the colonists; 
            that as no profession of belief (<trait type="religion"><label>Quakerism</label></trait> excepted) can exclude a man from the provincial legislature, 
so each religion tolerated by the state should be by the state maintained. They exclaim against 
disuniting religion and education, and insist that the reserves should be divided in shares proportionate 
to the number of members of each church—among the Episcopalians, <trait type="religion"><label>Presbyterians</label></trait>, <trait type="religion"><label>Roman Catholics</label></trait>, 
Wesleyan <trait type="religion"><label>Methodists</label></trait>, and <trait type="religion"><label>Baptists</label></trait>. This party is numerous, but not unanimous. In hostility to the 
exclusive pretensions of the <trait type="religion"><label>episcopal church</label></trait> they are agreed, but they seem to agree in nothing 
else; and some numerous and respectable sects are altogether excluded.</p> 
<p>A third party, and by far 
   the most numerous, require that the maintenance of the <orgName>clergy</orgName> should be left, as in the <placeName>United States</placeName>, 
   to the voluntary aid of their <orgName>congregation</orgName>, and the entire produce of the lands reserved for the education 
of the people.</p> 
<p>I have not been long enough in the country to consider the question practically, as applying 
to the peculiar wants and circumstances of the people; but theoretically I do not agree with any of 
these parties, and at present am content to listen to all I hear around me. With regard to the petition 
forwarded to the home government, it has been an ample source of ridicule that a house of parliament, 
of which many members could not read, and many more could not spell, should be thus zealous on the subject 
of education. In truth, I have seen some
   <pb n="33"/><seg type="pagenumber">31</seg>specimens of the writing and spelling of <roleName>honorable members</roleName>, men of influence and property too, at which 
it was impossible not to laugh; but I felt no disposition to join in the ridicule freely bestowed on 
the <roleName>writers</roleName>: it seemed any thing but ridiculous, that men who had not themselves received the advantage 
   of a good education, should be anxious to insure it to their <roleName type="family">children.</roleName> <persName>Mr. H.</persName> told me the other day, that 
in the distant townships not one person in twenty or thirty could read or write, or had the means of 
attaining such knowledge. On repeating this to <persName>Mr. В.</persName>, a <trait type="ethnicity"><label>native Canadian</label></trait>, and perfectly acquainted 
with the country, adding some expression of incredulity, he exclaimed, laughing, <q>"Not one in twenty 
or thirty!—Madam, not one in seventy!"</q></p> 
<p>The question, as a mere party question, did not interest me; 
but the strange, crude, ignorant, vague opinions I heard in conversation, and read in the debates and 
the provincial papers, excited my astonishment. It struck me that if I could get the <trait type="ethnicity"><label>English preface</label></trait> 
   to <persName>Victor Cousin</persName>'s report (of which I had a copy) printed in a cheap form, and circulated with the 
   newspapers, adding some of the statistical calculations, and some passages from <persName>Duppa</persName>'s report on the 
   education of the <roleName type="family">children of the poorer classes,</roleName> it might do some good—it might assist the people to 
some general principles on which to form opinions; whereas they all appeared to me astray, nothing that 
had been promulgated in <placeName>Europe</placeName> on this momentous subject had yet reached them; and the brevity and 
clearness of
<pb n="34"/><seg type="pagenumber">32</seg>this little preface, which exhibits the importance of a system of national education, and some general 
truths without admixture of any political or sectarian bias, would, I thought—I hoped—obtain for it a 
favorable reception. But, no; cold water was thrown upon me from every side—my interference in any 
way was so visibly distasteful, that I gave my project up with many a sigh, and I am afraid I shall 
always regret this. True, I am yet a stranger— helpless as to means, and <hi rend="italics">feeling</hi> my way in a social

         <p>While ranging my <trait type="ethnicity"><label>German books</label></trait> this morning, I fell upon the Correggio of Oehlenschläger, 
            and Die Schuld of Müllner; and I read both through carefully. The former pleased me <hi rend="italics">more</hi>, the latter 
            struck me <hi rend="italics">less</hi>, than when I read them both for the first time a year ago.</p> 
            <p>One despairs of nothing since 
the success of "Ion;" but would it be possible, think you, that the tragedy of "Correggio" could be 
exhibited in England with any thing like the success it met with in Germany ? Here—in England I mean—it 
might indeed <q>"fit audience find, though few,"</q> but would it meet with the same sympathy ?—would it even 
be endured with common patience by a mixed audience—such as hailed its appearance in Germany ? Here 
is a tragedy, of which the pervading in¬ terest is not low ambition and the pride of king3 ; nor love, 
nor terror, nor murder, nor the rivalship of princes, nor the fall of dynasties, nor any of the usual 
forms of tragic incident—but art, high art— its power as developed within the individual soul— its 
influence on the minds of others. This idea is embodied in the character of Correggio : yet he is no 
abstraction, but perfectly individualized. All those traits of his life and peculiar habits and 
dispo¬ sition, handed down by tradition, are most carefully preserved, and the result is a most 
admirable por¬ trait of the artist and the man. His gentleness, his tenderness, his sensitive modesty,
his sweet, loving, retiring disposition, are all touched with exquisite delicacy. The out-break of 
noble self-confidence,
when he exclaimed, after gazing on Raffaelle's St. Cecilia, <q>"Anch' io sono Tittore!"</q> is beautifully 
in¬ troduced. The sight of the same picture sent La Francia home to his bed to die, so at least it is 
said ; but Correggio was not a man to die of another's excellence, though too often doubting his own. 
The anecdote of the man who was saved from the rapa¬ city and vengeance of a robber, by an appeal to 
one of his pictures, and the story of his paying his apo¬ thecary with one of his finest works,* are 
also real incidents of the painter's life, introduced with the most picturesque effect. Those who have 
travelled through the forests of Catholic Germany and Italy, must often have seen a Madonna, ora 
Magdalen, in a rude frame, shrined against the knotted trunk of an old oak overshadow¬ ing the path ; 
the green grass waving round, a votive wreath of wild flowers hung upon the rude shrine, and in 
front a little space worn bare by the knees of travellers who have turned aside from their journey 
to rest in the cool shade, and put up an Ave Maria, oran Ora pro nobis. I well remember once coming 
on such a Madonna in a wild woodland path near Vollbrücken, in Upper Austria. Two little, half-naked 
children, and a gaunt, black-bearded wood-cutter, were kneeling before it ; and from afar the songs 
of some peasants gathering in the harvest were born on the air. The Magdalen of Cor¬ reggio, the same 
which is now in the Dresden gal¬ lery, and multiplied in prints and copies through
the known world, is represented without any violent stretch of probability as occupying such a 
situation i nor are we left in doubt as to the identity of the pic¬ ture ; it is described in three 
or four exquisite lines. It is beautiful—is it not 1 —where Correggio com¬ ments on his work, as he 
is presenting it to the old hermit : u Ein sündhaft Mädchen, das mit Reu' und Angst Wie ein gescheuchtes 
Reh zum Dickicht floh, Um der nachstellung ferner zu entgehen. Doch ist es schön von einem Weibe, 
meyn ich, Einmal gefallen wieder sich zu heben ; Es gibt sehr wen'ge Männer, die das können."* And 
the reply of Silvestro places the lovely form before us, painted in words. Welch schön Gemähide ί Der 
dunkle Schattenwald. die blonden Haare, Die weisse Наш, das himmel blau Gewand Die Jugendfülle und der 
Todtenkopf, Das Weiberhafte und das grosse Buch, Ihr habt mit vieler Kunst die Gegensätze In schöner 
Harmonie heir auf-gelöst»"t
The manner in which Correggio betrays his re¬ gret on parting with his picture, is also natural and most 
exquisite. " Die Dichter haben's gut ; sie können immer Die Kinder alle in der Nähe haben. Der Mahler 
ist ein armer Vater, der Sie in die weite Welt aussenden muss ; Da müssen sie nachher sich selbst 
versorgen."* Grouped around Correggio in every possible de¬ gree of harmony and contrast, we have a 
variety of figures all sufficiently marked, each in itself com¬ plete, and all aiding in carrying out 
the main effect, the apotheosis of the artist hero. Nor has Oehlenschläger made his tragedy the ve¬ hicle 
for mere declamation, nor for inculcating any particular system of art or set of principles. In 
Mi¬ chael Angelo .and in Giulio Romano we have exhi¬ bited two artist-minds as different from each 
other and from Antonio Correggio as can be imagined. The haughty, stern, arrogant, but magnanimous 
and magnificent Michael Angelo, can with difficulty be brought to appreciate, or even look upon a 
style so different from his own, and thunders out his rules of art like Olympian Jove. The gay, 
confident, gene-
rous, courteous Giulio Romano is less exclusive, if less severely grand, in his taste. The luxuriant 
grace of Correggio, the blending of the purely na¬ tural with the purely ideal, in his conceptions 
of beauty, are again distinct from both these great masters. Again the influence of art over minds 
va¬ riously constituted is exhibited in the tender wife of Correggio, the favorite model for his 
Madonnas : the old hermit Silvestro ; the high-born, beautiful enthusiast, Celestina, who places 
the laurel-wrëath the brow of the sleeping painter : and the pea¬ sant girl, Lauretta, who gives 
him drink when faint¬ ing with thirst; and the penitent robber; and the «areless young noble, with 
whom art is subservient to his vanity and his passions ; and the vulgar villain of the piece, 
Battista, who alone is absolutely in¬ sensible to its influence ;—all these form as beauti¬ ful a 
group, and as perfect in keeping, as we can meet in dramatic literature. Then there are such ■charming 
touehes of feeling, such splendid passages of description and aphorisms on art, which seize on the 
fancy and cling to the memory ! while the allusions ίο certain well-known pictures, bringing them 
before the mind's eye in a few expressive and characteris¬ tic words, are delicious to the amateur. 
The received account of the eause of Correggio's death rests on a tradition,* which later researches
render very problematical ; but it remains uncontra¬ dicted that he lived and died poor—that his health 
was feeble and delicate—his life retired and blame¬ less ι and the catastrophe has been so long current
and credited, that the poet has done well to adhere to the common tradition. In the very moment that 
Correggio sinks into death, a messenger arrives from the Duke of Mantua, with splendid offers of 
patron¬ age. He comes too late. Art and the world are the heirs of the great man's genius ; his poor 
family fol¬ low him heart-broken to the grave. The Schuld of Adolf Müllner does not produce such an 
overpowering effect on the imagination the second time of reading, because we are not hurried 
forward by the interest of the story ; but in one res^ pect it has affected me more deeply than 
at first. Hugo says, " Mich dunket, nie Sollten Nord und Süd sich küssen !"* 3 And all through 
this fine play the spirit of the North and the spirit of the South are brought into beauti¬ ful 
yet fearful contrast. The passions which form the groundwork of the piece are prepared amid the 
palaces and orange-groves of the glowing South : the catastrophe evolved amid the deserts and pine-
forests of the North ; and in the fair, still-souled, but heroic Scandinavian maid, Jerta, and the 
dark, impassioned Elvira, we have the personified senti¬ ment of the North and the South; Has it 
ever occurred to you that Coleridge must have had this tragedy in his mind when he wrote his " Remorse ?"
What a slight touch upon an extreme link will send us back sometimes through a long, long chain of 
memories and associations ! A word, a name, has dent me from Toronto to Vienna ; what a flight ! what 
a contrast !—it makes even Fancy herself breathless ! Did I ever mention to you Madame Arneth ? When 
the " Schuld" was produced at Vienna, she played the Scandinavian Jerta, and I have heard the effect of 
her representation com¬ pared, in its characteristic purity and calmness, and mild intellectual beauty, 
to the " moonlight on a snow-wreath"—a comparison which gave me a vivid impression of its truth. Madame 
Arneth was her¬ self not unlike the fair and serious Jerta. The question has been often agitated, often 
con- trovertedt; but I am inclined to maintain the opinion elsewhere expressed, that there is nothing 
in the profession of an actress which is incompatible with the respect due to us as women—the cultivation 
of every feminine virtue—the practice of every private duty. I have conversed with those who think 
other¬ wise, and yet continue to frequent the theatre as an amusement, and even as a source of mental 
de¬ light and improvement j and this I conceive to be a dereliction of principle—wrong in itself, and 
yOL. ι. 4*
the cause of wrong. A love for dramatic repres en- tation, for imitative action, is in the elements of 
our human náture ; we see it in <roleName type="family">children,</roleName> in <trait type="race"><label>savages</label></trait>, in all ages, in all nations ;—we cannot help it—
it is even so. That the position of an actress should sometimes be a false one—a dangerous one even for 
a female, is not the fault of the profession, but the effect of the public opinion of the profession. 
When fashion, or conventional law, or public opi¬ nion, denounce as inexpedient what they cannot prove 
to be wrong—stigmatize what they allow— encourage and take delight in what they affect to contemn—what 
wonder that from such barbarous, such senseless inconsistency, should spring a whole heap of abuses and 
mistakes ? As to the idea that acting, as a profession, is incompatible with female virtue and modesty, 
it is not merely an insult to the estimable women who have adorned and still adorn the stage, but to all 
womankind ; it makes me blush with indignation. Unreflecting people—the world is full of such—point to 
the numerous instances which might be cited to the contrary. I have been perplexed by them sometimes in 
argument, but never on consideration and examination ; and with regard to some other evils, not less, as 
it appears to me, in a moral point of view, I do not see their ne cessary connexion with the stage as a 
profession Vanity, jealousy, selfishness, the spirit of intrigue, the morbid effects of over-excitement, 
are not con fined to actresses ; if women placed in this position do require caution and dignity to ward 
off tempta¬ tion, and self-control to resist it, and some know-
ledge of their own structure and the liabilities in¬ curred by their profession, in order to manage 
bet¬ ter their own health, moral and physical, then they jnly require what all women should possess—what 
every woman needs, no matter what her position. But to return to Madame Arneth. At Vienna, some years ago, 
there lived three cele¬ brated actresses, all beautiful, and young, and gifted. Sophie Müller was first 
mentioned to me by Schlegel ; he spoke of her with rapturous admira¬ tion as the most successful representative 
of some of Shakspeare's characters that had yet been seen in Germany, and she seems to have left an 
inefface- ble impression on those who saw her play Chrim- hilde in the " Niebelung." She was surrounded 
by admirers, adorers, yet I never heard that one among them could boast of being distinguished even by a 
preference ; austere to herself, devoted to hei¬ art, which she studied assiduously, her ambition 
centered in it ; in the mean time she was perform¬ ing all the duties of a daughter to an aged father, 
and of a mother to a family of younger brothers and sisters ; and her house was a model of good order 
and propriety. She died in 1830. Not long before died Anna Krüger, equally blame¬ less in her conduct 
and reputation as a woman, but in all other respects negligent of herself and of her own interests. She 
was remarkably free from all selfishness or jealousy, charitable and good, and universally beloved. Her 
representation of spirited or heroic characters, in comedy and in tragedy, has
been described tome as wonderfully fine. Schiller's Joan of Arc was her chef d'œuvre. The third was 
Antoinette Adamberger, now Madame Arneth, whom I am happy and proud to number among my friends. Her 
former name can¬ not be unknown to you, for it has a dear yet melan¬ choly celebrity throughout all 
Germany, and is in¬ separably associated with the literature of her country, as the betrothed bride 
of Theodore Korner, the poet-hero of the war of deliverance. It was not till we had been for some time 
intimate that I ever heard her allude to Korner. One evening as we were sitting alone, she gave me, with 
much feeling and graphic power, and even more simplicity, some particulars of her first interview with 
him, and the circumstances which led to their engagement. I should tell you that she was at the time a 
favorite actress of the Court Theatre, and excelled particu¬ larly in all characters that required more 
of delicacy, and grace, and dignity, than of power and passion ; those of Thekla in the " Wallenstein," 
and Jerta in the " Schuld," being considered as her master¬ pieces. Of her judgment as an artiste I 
could form some idea, from an analysis into which 1 once tempt¬ ed her of theBeatrice in Schiller's
" Braut von Mes¬ sina," a character in which she is said to have excell¬ ed, and which, in its tender 
delicacy and almost evanescent grace, might be compared to Perdita. To analyze all the passive beauty 
and power of Schiller's conception, must have required a just and exquisite taste, and to render them 
with such felicity and effect, a person corresponding in girlish deli-
cacy. Yet, perhaps, in her youthful years, when she played Beatrice divinely, Madame Arneth could not 
have analyzed the character as ingeniously as she did when a ripened judgment and more culti¬ vated 
taste enabled her to reflect on her own con¬ ception. This, however, is digressing; for the moral 
qualities, not the intellectual powers, of the actress, are what I am contending for. Theodore Körner 
came to Vienna in 1813, bringing with him his " Grime Domino," a piece composed expressly or Anna Krüger 
and Antoinette Adamberger. These two young women, differing altogether in character, were united by 
the most tender friend¬ ship, and a sincere admiration for each other's par¬ ticular talent. I have 
been told that it was delight¬ ful to see them play together in the same piece, the perfect understanding 
which existed between them producing an effect of harmony and reality which was felt, rather than perceived, 
by the audience. At the period of Körner's arrival, Antoinette was ill in consequence of the extreme 
severity of the win¬ ter of that year, and the rehearsal of the " Grüne Domino" was put off from day to 
day, from week to week, tili Körner became absolutely impatient. At this time he had not been introduced 
to Antoi¬ nette, and it was suspected that the beauty of Anna Krüger had captivated him. At length, 
the conva¬ lescence of the principal actress was announced, the day forthe long-deferred rehearsal 
arrived, and the performers had assembled in the green-room. Now, it happened that in the time of 
the late empress,*
the representation of Schiller's " Marie Stuart" had been forbidden, because her imperial majesty 
had been greatly scandalized by the indecorous quarrel scene between Queen Elizabeth and Queen Mary, 
and particularly by the catastrophe of the latter, regarding the whole play as extremely dangerous 
and derogatory to all crowned heads, more espe¬ cially female ones. On her death it was hoped that 
this prohibition would be repealed, and the perform¬ ers presented a petition to that effect. The 
empe¬ ror, however, steadily refused, on the plea that he had proinised the empress never to permit 
the repre¬ sentation of the tragedy.* The refusal had just been received, and the whole corps dramatique 
were in a state of commotion, and divided on the merits of the case. Körner, in particular, was in a 
perfect fever of indignation, and exclaimed, in no measured terms, against the edict which deprived 
the public of one of Schiller's masterpieces, in tenderness to the caprices of an old woman now in 
her grave, etcetera. The greater number of those present sympathized with him. The dispute was at 
its height when Antoinette entered the room, still weak from recent illness, and wrapped up in cloaks 
and furs. Her comrades crowded around her with congratulations - and expressions of affection, and 
insisted that the matter in dispute should be referred to " Toni ;" Körner, meanwhile, standing by 
in proud silence ;
ANTOINETTE ADAMBERGER. 47 he had not yet been introduced. When the affair was stated, and the opinions 
of the majority vehe¬ mently pressed on her, she replied in her gentle manner, " I do not pretend to 
judge about the in¬ jury done to the public, or the expediency or inex¬ pediency of the matter ; it 
is a simple question be¬ tween right and wrong—between truth and false¬ hood. For myself, I can only 
say, that if I had made a promise to a person I loved, or to any one, I would keep it as long as I 
had life myself, and the death of that person would render such a promise not less, but more binding, 
more sacred, if possi¬ ble." This simple appeal to principle and truth silenced all. Korner said no 
more, but his attention was fixed, and from that moment, as he told her after¬ wards, he loved her ; 
his feelings were interested before he had even looked into her eyes ; and it is no wonder that those 
eyes, when revealed, com¬ pleted her conquest. Within a few weeks they were betrothed lovers, and within 
a few months afterwards the patriotic war (die Freiheits-Kriege) broke out, and Körner joined Lutzow's 
volunteers. His fate is well known. Young and handsome, a poet and a hero, loving, and in the full 
assurance of being loved, with all life's fairest visions and purest affections fresh about his head 
and heart, he perished—the miniature of " Toni" being found within his bosom next to the little 
pocket-book in which he had written the Song of the Sword—the first shattered by the bullet which 
had found his heart, the latter stained with his blood ;
I have seen it-—held it in my hand ! Now, will you believe, that within three or four months 
afterwards, when Antoinette was under the obligation to resume her professional duties, the first 
character she was ordered to play was that of Thekla ? In vain she entreated to be spared this 
outrage to every feeling of a heart yet bleeding from her loss ; the greater her reluctance, the 
greater the effect which would be produced on the curiosity and sympathy of the pub¬ lic ;—this, I 
suppose, was the cold calculation of the directory! She was not excused; and after going through the 
scene in which the Swedish captain re¬ lates to Thekla the death ofher lover,* the poor An¬ toinette 
was carried from the stage by her aunt al¬ most lifeless, and revived only to give way to such agonies' 
of grief and indignation as threatened her reason. Madame Arneth is remarkably culm and simple in her
manner, and more than twenty years had elapsed since she had been thus insulted and tortur¬ ed ; but 
when she alluded to this part of her history, she became gradually convulsed with emotion, trem¬ bled 
in every limb, and pressed her hands upon her eyes, from which the tears would gush in spite of an 
-effort to restrain them. And to this, you will say, an actress could be exposed 1 Yes ; and I remem¬ 
ber another instance, when under circumstances as cruel and as revolting, a young and admired actress 
was hurried before the public in an agony of reluc¬ tance ; but still I do say, that such exhibitions 
are
ïiot necessarily or solely confined to the profession of the stage ; woman, as a legal property, is 
sub¬ jected to them in her conventional position ; a woman may be brought into a church against her 
will, libelled and pilloried in an audacious newspaper; an English matron may be dragged from private 
life into a court of justice, exposed, guiltless and helpless, to the public obloquy or the public 
sympa¬ thy, in shame and in despair. If such a scene can by possibility take place, one stage is not 
worse than another. Antoinette had suffered what a woman of a quiet but proud temper never forgets or 
forgives. She had made up her mind to quit the stage, and there was only one way of doing so with honor. 
Four years after the death of Korner she married Mr. Arneth, one of the directors of the Imperial Museum, 
a learned and amiable man, considerably older than herself,* andwith whom she haslived happily. Before I 
left Vienna she presented me with a book which Korner had given her, containing his autograph and the 
dramas he had written for her—" Die Toni,"
"der Grüne Domino," and others. I exclaimed thoughtlessly, " О how can you part with it ?" and she replied 
with a sweet seriousness, " When I mar¬ ried a worthy man who loved me and trusted me, 1 thought there 
should be no wavering of the heart between past recollections and present duties: I put this and all 
other objects connected with that first period of my life entirely away, and I have never looked at it 
since. Take it ! and believe me, even now, it is better in your hands than in mine." And mine it shall 
never leave. Madame Arneth once described to me the admi¬ rable acting of Schroeder in Medea, when playing 
with her own children : she treated them, however, with savage roughness, and when remonstrated with, 
she replied, " the children were her own, and she had a right to do what she liked with them." "'That 
was certainly her affair," added Madame Arneth, " but I would not for the whole world have exhibited myself 
before my own children in such a character/' Is not this a woman worthy of all love, all respect, all 
reverence ? and is not this the sentiment of duty which is, or should be, " the star to every wandering 
" Ъагк ?" And thus I have read and scribbled away two long days. The eve of my intended excursion is come 
at last ; I am looking forward to to-morrow with almost childish pleasure and impatience. the weather is 
most ominous ; but I shall see Niagara in all its wintry magnificence—a sight granted to few. О ! in this 
moment I do not envy you the blue Mediterranean, nor the summer skies and orange-groves of your southern 
island !</p>

         <p><date when="1837-01-23">January 23</date>.</p> <p>At half-past eight <persName>Mr. Campbell</persName> was at the door in a very pretty commodious sleigh, in form 
like a barouchey with the head up. I was absolutely buried in furs; a blanket, netted for me by the 
kindest hands, of the finest lamb's-wool, rich in color, and as light and elastic as it was deliciously 
warm, was folded round my limbs; buffalo and bear skins were heaped over all, and every breath of the 
external air excluded by every possible device. <persName>Mr. Campbell</persName> drove his own gray horses; and thus fortified 
and accoutred, off we flew, literally <q>"urged by storms along the slippery way,"</q> for the weather was 
terrific.</p> 
<p>I think that but for this journey I never could have imagined the sublime desolation of a 
northern winter, and it has impressed me strongly. In the first place, the whole atmosphere appeared 
as if
<pb n="54"/><seg type="pagenumber">52</seg>converted into snow, which fell in thick, tiny, starry flakes, till the buffalo robes and furs about 
us appeared like swansdown, and the harness on the horses of the same delicate material. The whole 
   earth was a white waste: the road, on which the sleigh-track was only just perceptible, ran for miles 
in a straight line; on each side rose the dark, melancholy pine-forest, slumbering drearily in the 
hazy air. Between us and the edge of the forest were frequent spaces of cleared or half-cleared land, 
spotted over with the black charred stumps and blasted trunks of once magnificent trees, projecting 
from the snowdrift. These, which are perpetually recurring objects in a <trait type="ethnicity"><label>Canadian landscape</label></trait>, have a 
most melancholy appearance. Sometimes wide openings occurred to the left, bringing us in sight of <placeName>Lake 
   Ontario</placeName>, and even in some places down upon the edge of it: in this part of the lake the enormous 
body of the water and its incessant movement prevents it from freezing, and the dark waves rolled in, 
heavily plunging on the icy shore with a sullen booming sound. A few roods from the land, the cold gray 
waters, and the cold, gray, snow-encumbered atmosphere, were mingled with each other, and each seemed 
either. The only living thing I saw in a space of about twenty miles was a magnificent bald-headed 
eagle, which, after sailing a few turns in advance of us, alighted on the topmost bough of a blasted 
pine, and slowly folding his great wide wings, looked down upon us as we glided beneath him.</p> 
         <p>The first village we passed through was 
            <pb n="55"/><seg type="pagenumber">53</seg><placeName>Springfield</placeName>, on the river <placeName>Credit</placeName>, a river of some importance in summer, but now, converted into ice, heaped 
            up with snow, and undistinguishable. Twenty miles further, we stopped at <placeName>Oakville</placeName> to refresh ourselves 
            and the horses.</p>
            <p><placeName>Oakville</placeName> stands close upon the lake, at the mouth of a little river called <placeName>Sixteen Mile 
               Creek</placeName>; it owes its existence to a gentleman of the name of <persName>Chisholm</persName>, and, from its situation and 
other local circumstances, bids fair to become a place of importance. In the summer it is a frequented 
harbor, and carries on a considerable trade in <hi rend="italics">lumber</hi>, for so they characteristically call timber in 
this country. From its dock-yards I am told that a fine steamboat and a dozen schooners have been already 
launched.</p> 
         <p>In summer, the country round is rich and beautiful, with a number of farms all in a high state
of cultivation; but <placeName>Canada</placeName> in winter and in summer must be like two different regions. At present 
            the mouth of the creek is frozen up; all trade, all ship-building suspended. <placeName>Oakville</placeName> presents the 
appearance of a straggling hamlet, containing a few frame and log-houses; one brick house, (the 
grocery store, or general shop, which in a new <trait type="ethnicity"><label>Canadian village</label></trait> is always the best house in the place,) 
            a little <trait type="religion"><label>Methodist</label></trait> church, painted green and white, but as yet no <roleName>resident preacher</roleName>; and an inn 
            dignified by the name of the "<placeName>Oakville House Hotel</placeName>." Where there is a store, a tavern, and a church, 
            habitations soon rise around them. <placeName>Oakville</placeName> contains at present more than three hundred <roleName>inhabitants</roleName>, 
            who are now <seg type="pagesignature"> 5*</seg>
<pb n="56"/><seg type="pagenumber">54</seg>subscribing among themselves for a schoolmaster and a resident <roleName>clergyman</roleName>.</p> 
            <p>I stood conversing in the porch, 
and looking about me, till I found it necessary to seek shelter in the house, before my nose was absolutely 
taken off by the ice-blast. The little parlor was solitary, and heated like an oven. Against the wall were 
stuck a few vile prints, taken out of <trait type="ethnicity"><label>old American magazines</label></trait>; there was the <persName>Duchess de Berri</persName> in her 
wedding-dress, and as a pendant, the Modes de Paris—<q>"Robe de tulle garnie de fleurs —coiffure 
nouvelle, inventée par <persName>Mons. Plaisir</persName>."</q> The incongruity was but too laughable! I looked round me for 
some amusement or occupation, and at last spied a book open, and turned down upon its face. I pounced 
upon it as a prize; and what do you think it was? <q>"Devinez, madame! je vous le donne en trois, 
je vous le donne en quatre!"</q> it was—Don Juan! And so, while looking from the window on a scene 
which realized all you can imagine of the desolation of <trait type="race"><label>savage</label></trait> life, mixed up with just so much of 
               the common-place vulgarity of <trait type="race"><label>civilized</label></trait> life as sufficed to spoil it, I amused myself reading of 
               the <persName>Lady Adeline Amundeville</persName> and her precious coterie, and there anent. 
               <lg><l>Society is smoothed to that excess,</l> 
                  <l>That manners hardly differ more than dress.</l> 
                  <l>Our ridicules are kept in the back ground,</l>
                  <l>Ridiculous enough, but also dull;</l>
                  <l>Professions, too, are no more to be found</l>

A delineation, by the way, which might almost reconcile one to a more savage locality than that around me.</p> 
               <p>While I was reading, the mail-coach between <placeName>Hamilton</placeName> and <placeName>Toronto</placeName> drove up to the door; and because you 
               shall understand what sort of a thing a <trait type="ethnicity"><label>Canadian mail</label></trait> is, and thereupon sympathize in my irrepressible 
wonder and amusement, I must sketch it for you.. It was a heavy wooden edifice, about the size and 
form of an old-fashioned lord mayor's coach, placed on runners, and raised about a foot from the ground; 
the whole was painted of a bright red, and long icicles hung from the roof. This monstrous machine 
disgorged from its portal eight men-creatures, all enveloped in bearskins and shaggy dreadnoughts, 
and pea-jackets, and fur-caps down upon their noses, looking like a procession of bears on their hind-legs,
tumbling out of a <roleName>showman</roleName>'s caravan. They proved, however, when undisguised, to be gentlemen, most of 
                  them going up to <placeName>Toronto</placeName> to attend their duties in the <orgName>house of assembly</orgName>. One of these, a personage of 
                  remarkable height and size, and a peculiar cast of features, was introduced to me as <persName>Mr. Kerr</persName>, the 
possessor of large estates in the neghborhood, partly acquired, and partly inherited from his 
<roleName type="family">father-in-law,</roleName> <persName>Brandt</persName>, the famous <roleName>chief of the Six Nations</roleName>. <persName>Kerr</persName> himself has <trait type="race"><label>Indian blood</label></trait> in his veins.
                  His son, young <persName>Kerr</persName>, a fine boy about ten years old, is
                  <pb n="58"/><seg type="pagenumber">56</seg>the present acknowledged <roleName>chief of the Six Nations</roleName>, in his <roleName type="family">mother's right,</roleName> the hereditary chieftainship 
                  being always transmitted <hi rend="italics">through</hi> the female, though passing <hi rend="italics">over</hi> her. <persName>Mrs. Kerr</persName>, the <roleName type="family">eldest daughter</roleName> of
                  <persName>Brandt</persName>, is a <trait type="ethnicity"><label>squaw</label></trait> of <trait type="race"><label>unmixed Indian blood</label></trait>, and has been described to me as a very superior creature. 
                  She has the good sense to wear habitually her <trait type="race"><label>Indian costume</label></trait>, slightly modified, in which she looks and 
                  moves a <roleName>princess</roleName>, graceful and unrestrained, while in a fashionable <trait type="ethnicity"><label>European dress</label></trait> the effect is exactly 
the reverse.</p> 
<p>Much mischief has been done in this neighborhood by beasts of prey, and the deer, driven 
by hunger and the wolves from their forest haunts, have been killed, near the settlements, in unusual 
numbers. One of the <trait type="race"><label>Indians</label></trait>, whom I saw at <placeName>Toronto</placeName>, on returning by this road, shot with his new rifle 
   eight deer in one day, and sold them at <placeName>Hamilton</placeName> for three dollars each—no bad day's hunting. The 
   venison in <placeName>Canada</placeName> is good and abundant, but very lean, very unlike <trait type="ethnicity"><label>English venison</label></trait>; the price is generally 
four or six cents (two pence or three pence) a pound.</p> 
<p>After taking some refreshment, we set forth again.
   The next village we passed was called, oddly enough, <placeName>Wellington Square</placeName>; it has been recently laid out, 
   and contains about twenty wooden houses; then came <placeName>Port Nelson</placeName>, <persName>Mr. Kerr</persName>'s place. Instead of going round
   the head of the lake by <placeName>Hamilton</placeName>, we crossed that very remarkable tongue or slip of land which divides 
   <placeName>Burlington Bay</placeName> from <placeName>Lake Ontario</placeName>; these were, in fact, two separate
   <pb n="59"/><seg type="pagenumber">57</seg>lakes till a channel was cut through the narrow isthmus. <placeName>Burlington Bay</placeName>, containing about forty square 
miles, is now one sheet of ice, and on the slip of land, which is near seven miles in length, and about 
two hundred yards in width, we found the snow lying so deep and in such irregular drifts, that we 
proceeded with difficulty. At length we reached <placeName>Stony Creek</placeName>, a village celebrated in these parts as the 
   scene of the bloodiest battle fought between the <trait type="ethnicity"><label>English</label></trait> and <trait type="ethnicity"><label>Americans</label></trait> during the last war. We had 
intended to sleep here, but the inn was so uncomfortable and unpromising, that after a short rest we 
determined on proceeding ten miles further to <placeName>Beamsville</placeName>.</p> 
<p>It was now dark, and, the snow· falling thick, 
   it soon became impossible to distinguish the sleigh-track. <persName>Mr. Campbell</persName> loosened the reins and left the 
horses to their own instinct, assuring me it was the safest way of proceeding. After this I remember 
no more distinctly, except that I ceased to hear the ever-jingling sleigh-bells. I awoke, as if from the 
influence of nightmare, to find the sleigh overturned, myself lying in the bottom of it half-smothered, 
and my companions nowhere to be seen; they were floundering in the snow behind.</p> 
<p>Luckily, when we had 
stretched ourselves and shaken off the snow, we were found unhurt in life and limb. We had fallen down 
a bank into the bed of a rivulet, or a mill-race, I believe, which, being filled up with snow, was quite 
as soft, only a little colder, than a down-bed. Frightened I was, bewildered rather, but "effective" 
in a moment. It
   <pb n="60"/><seg type="pagenumber">58</seg>was impossible for the gentlemen to leave the horses, which were plunging furiously up to the shoulders 
in the snow, and had already broken the sleigh; so I set off to seek assistance, having received 
proper directions. Fortunately we were not far from <placeName>Beamsville</placeName>. My beacon-light was to be the chimney 
of a forge, from which the bright sparks were streaming up into the dark wintry air, visible from a 
great distance. After scrambling through many a snow-drift, up hill and down hill, I at last reached 
the forge, where a man was hammering amain at a ploughshare; such was the din, that I called for some 
time unheard; at last, as I advanced into the red light of the fire, the man's eyes fell upon me, and 
I shall never forget his look as he stood poising his hammer, with the most comical expression of 
bewildered amazement. I could not get an answer from him; he opened his mouth and repeated <hi rend="italics">aw</hi>! staring 
at me, but without speaking or moving. I turned away in despair, yet half laughing, and after some more 
scrambling up and down, I found myself in the village, and was directed to the inn. Assistance was 
immediately sent off to my friends, and in a few minutes the supper table was spread, a pile of logs higher
than myself blazing away in the chimney; venison-steaks, and fried fish, coffee, hot cakes, cheese, 
and whiskey punch, (the <roleName>traveller</roleName>'s fare in <placeName>Canada</placeName>,) were soon smoking on the table; our <roleName>landlady</roleName> presided, 
   and the evening passed merrily away.</p> 
   <p>The <roleName>old landlady</roleName> of this inn amused me exceedingly; she had 
passed all her life among her equals
      <pb n="61"/><seg type="pagenumber">59</seg>in station and education, and had no idea of any distinction between <roleName>guests</roleName> and <roleName>customers</roleName>; and while 
      caressing and attending on me, like an old <roleName type="family">mother</roleName> or an old <roleName>nurse</roleName>, gave me her history, and that of all
      her kith and kin. <date when="1797">Forty years before</date>, her <roleName type="family">husband</roleName> had emigrated, and built a hovel, and made a little 
clearing on the edge of the lake. At that time there was no other habitation within many miles of them, 
and they passed several years in almost absolute solitude. They have now three farms, some hundred 
acres of land, and have brought up <roleName type="family">nine sons and daughters,</roleName> most of whom are married, and settled on 
lands of their own. She gave me a horrid picture of the prevalence of drunkenness, the vice and the 
curse of this country.</p> 
<p>I can give you no idea of the intense cold of this night; I was obliged to wrap 
my fur cloak round me before I could go to sleep. I rose ill and could eat no breakfast, in spite of
all the coaxing of the good <roleName>landlady</roleName>; she got out her best tea, kept for her own drinking, (which tasted 
for all the world, like musty hay,) and buttered toast, i. e. fried bread steeped in melted butter, and 
fruit preserved in molasses—to all which I shall get used in time—I must try, at least, or <q>"thank 
Heaven, <hi rend="italics">fasting</hi>."</q> We proceeded eighteen miles further, to <placeName>St. Catherine's</placeName>, the situation of which 
appeared to me very pretty even in winter, and must be beautiful in summer. I am told it is a place 
of importance, owing to the vicinity of the <placeName>Weiland Canal</placeName>, which connects <placeName>Lake Ontario</placeName> with <placeName>Lake Erie</placeName>: 
   it contains more than seven hundred <roleName>inhabitants</roleName>. The school here
   <pb n="62"/><seg type="pagenumber">60</seg>is reckoned the best in the district. We passed this morning several streams, which in summer flow 
into the lake, now all frozen up and undistinguishable, except by the wooden bridges which cross them, 
and the mills, now still and useless, erected along their banks. These streams have the names of <placeName>Thirty 
   Mile Creek</placeName>, <placeName>Forty Mile Creek</placeName>, <placeName>Twenty Mile Creek</placeName>, and so on; but wherefore I could not discover.</p> 
         <p>From <placeName>St. Catherine's</placeName> we proceeded twelve miles farther, to <placeName>Niagara</placeName>. There I found some old <trait type="ethnicity"><label>English</label></trait> or 
            rather <trait type="ethnicity"><label>Irish friends</label></trait> ready to welcome me with joyous affection; and surely there is not a more blessed 
            sight than the face of an <roleName>old friend</roleName> in a new land!</p> <!-- horizontal line -->

         <p>The town of <placeName>Niagara</placeName> presents the same torpid appearance which seems to prevail everywhere at this Season; it is situated at the 
            mouth of the <placeName>river Niagara</placeName>, and is a place of much business and resort when the navigation is open. The 
lake does not freeze here, owing to the depth of its majestic waters; neither does the river, from 
the velocity of its current; yet both are blocked up by the huge fragments of ice which are brought 
down from <placeName>Lake Erie</placeName>, and which, uniting and accumulating at the mouth of the river, form a field of ice 
extending far into the lake. How beautiful it looked to-day, broken into vast longitudinal flakes of 
alternate white and azure, and sparkling in the sunshine!</p>
 <pb n="63"/><p><seg type="pagenumber">61</seg></p><p>There are dock-yards here lately erected, dry docks iron works of some extent, and a steam-engine for 
   hauling up vessels for repair; the <roleName>chief proprietor</roleName> is a good-natured and public-spirited gentleman, 
   <persName>Captain Melville</persName>. He tells me that upwards of twenty thousand pounds have been expended on these works,
   and they employ constantly about fifty <roleName>workmen</roleName>; yet, in spite of this, and in spite of its local 
   advantages, as a frontier town and the oldest settlement in <placeName>Upper Canada</placeName>, <placeName>Niagara</placeName> does not make progress. 
The population and the number of houses have remained nearly stationary for the last five years. I find 
the people complaining much of the want of a good school.</p> 
         <p>The land all around <placeName>Niagara</placeName> is particularly fine
and fertile, and it has been longer cleared and cultivated than in other parts of the province. The 
country, they say, is most beautiful in summer, taxes are trifling, scarcely felt, and there are no poor-rates; 
yet ignorance, recklessness, despondency, and inebriety, seem to prevail. A------, who has been settled 
here for five years, and В ------, himself a <trait type="ethnicity"><label>Canadian</label></trait>, rate the morality of the <trait type="ethnicity"><label>Canadian population</label></trait> 
frightfully low; lying and drunkenness they spoke of as nearly universal; men who come here with sober 
habits quickly fall into the vice of the country; and those who have the least propensity to drinking 
find the means of gratification comparatively cheap, and little check from public opinion.

<pb n="64"/><seg type="pagenumber">62</seg>Though I parody, I do not jest; for in truth, if all, or even half, of what I heard to-day be true, this 
            is a horrible state of things. I asked for a <roleName>bookseller</roleName>'s shop; there is not one in the town, but plenty 
            of taverns. There is a duty of thirty per cent, on books imported from the <placeName>United States</placeName>, and the expense 
            on books imported from <placeName>England</placeName> adds at least one-third to their price; but there is no duty on whiskey. 
<q>"If government,"</q> said В ------, <q>"were to lay a duty on whiskey, we should only have the province overrun 
with illicit stills, and another source of crime and depravity added to the main one."</q></p> 
         <p><persName>Sir Francis Head</persName> recommended to me, playfully, to get up a grievance, that I might have an excuse for paying him a visit. 
I think I will represent to his Excellency the dearness of books and the cheapness of whiskey. I could 
not invent a worse grievance either in earnest or in jest.</p> 
<p>The opposite shore, about a quarter of a mile 
   off, is the <placeName>State of New-York</placeName>. The <trait type="ethnicity"><label>Americans</label></trait> have a fort on their side, and we also have a fort on ours. 
   What the amount of <hi rend="italics">their</hi> garrison may be I know not, but our force consists of three <roleName>privates</roleName> and a

   I mistook for a dilapidated brewery. This is charming—it <hi rend="italics">looks</hi> like peace and security, at all events.</p>
         <pb n="65"/><p><seg type="pagenumber">63</seg></p><p><date when="1837-01-29">January 29</date>.</p> <p>Well! I have seen these cataracts of <placeName>Niagara</placeName>, which have thundered in 
my mind's ear ever since I can remember—which have been my <q>"childhood's thought, my youth's desire,"</q> since 
first my imagination was awakened to wonder and to wish. I have beheld them, and shall I whisper it to 
you!—but, О tell it not among the Philistines!—I wish I had not! I wish they were still a thing 
unbeheld—a thing to be imagined, hoped, and anticipated— something to live for:—the reality has displaced 
from my mind an allusion far more magnificent than itself—I have no words for my utter disappointment: 
yet I have not the presumption to suppose that all I have heard and read of <placeName>Niagara</placeName> is false or 
exaggerated—that every expression of astonishment, enthusiasm, rapture, is affectation or hyperbole.
No! it must be my own fault. <placeName>Terni</placeName>, and some of the <trait type="ethnicity"><label>Swiss cataracts</label></trait> leaping from their mountains, have 
            affected me a thousand times more than all the immensity of <placeName>Niagara</placeName>. О I could beat myself! and now there 
is no help!—the first moment, the first impression is over—is lost; though I should live a thousand 
years, long as <placeName>Niagara</placeName> itself shall roll, I can never see it again for the first time. Something is gone 
            that cannot be restored. What has come over my soul and senses?—I am no longer <persName>Anna</persName>—I am metamorphosed
—I am translated—I am an ass's head, a clod, a wooden spoon, a fat weed growing on Lethe's bank, 
a stock, a stone, a petrifaction—for have I not seen <placeName>Niagara</placeName>, the
            <pb n="66"/><seg type="pagenumber">64</seg>wonder of wonders; and felt—no words can tell <hi rend="italics">what</hi> disappointment!</p> 
            <p>But, to take things in order: 
we set off for the Falls yesterday morning, with the intention of spending the day there, sleeping, 
and returning the next day to <placeName>Niagara</placeName>. The distance is fourteen miles, by a road winding along the 
               banks of the <placeName>Niagara river</placeName>, and over the <placeName>Queenston heights</placeName>; and beautiful must this land be in summer, 
since even now it is beautiful. The flower garden, the trim shrubbery, the lawn, the meadow with its 
hedgerows, when frozen up and wrapt in snow, always give me the idea of something not only desolate 
but dead: Nature is the ghost of herself, and trails a spectral pall; I always feel a kind of pity—
a touch of melancholy—when at this season I have wandered among withered shrubs and buried flower-beds; 
but here, in the wilderness, where Nature is wholly independent of art, she does not die, nor yet mourn; 
she lies down to rest on the bosom of Winter, and the aged one folds her in his robe of ermine and jewels, 
and rocks her with his hurricanes, and hushes her to sleep. How still it was! how calm, how vast the 
glittering white waste and the dark purple forests! The sun shone out, and the sky was without a 
cloud; yet we saw few people, and for many miles the hissing of our sleigh, as we flew along upon our 
dazzling path, and the tinkling of the sleigh-bells, were the only sounds we heard. When we were within 
four or five miles of the <placeName>Falls</placeName>, I stopped the sleigh from time to time to listen for the roar of the 
cataracts, but the state of the 
<pb n="67"/><seg type="pagenumber">65</seg>atmoaphere was not favorable for the transmission of sound, and the silence was unbroken.</p> 
         <p>Such was the deep, 
monotonous tranquillity which prevailed on every side—so exquisitely pure and vestal-like the robe in 
which all nature lay slumbering around us, I could scarce believe that this whole frontier district is 
not only remarkable for the prevalence of vice, but of dark and desperate crime.</p> 
         <p>Mr, Α., who is a <roleName>magistrate</roleName>, pointed out to me a lonely house by the way-side, where, on a dark stormy night in the 
            preceding winter, he had surprised and arrested a gang of <roleName>forgers</roleName> and <roleName>coiners</roleName>; it was a fearful 
description. For some time my impatience had been thus beguiled—impatience and suspense much like 
those of a child at a theatre before the curtain rises. My imagination had been so impressed by the 
vast height of the <placeName>Falls</placeName>, that I was constantly looking in an upward direction, when, as we came to 
            the brow of a hill, my companion suddenly checked the horses, and exclaimed, <q>"<placeName>The Falls</placeName>!"</q></p> 
         <p>I was not, for an instant, aware of their presence; we were yet at a distance, looking <hi rend="italics">down</hi> upon them; 
and I saw at one glance a flat extensive plain; the sun having withdrawn its beams for the moment, 
there was neither light, nor shade, nor color. In the midst were seen the two great cataracts, but 
merely as a feature in the wide landscape. The sound was by no means overpowering, and the clouds 
of spray, which <persName>Fanny Butler</persName> called so beautifully the <q>"everlasting incense of the waters,"</q> <seg type="pagesignature">6*</seg>
<pb n="68"/><seg type="pagenumber">66</seg>now condensed ere they rose by the excessive cold, fell round the base of the cataracts in fleecy 
folds, just concealing that furious embrace of the waters above and the waters below. All the associations 
which in imagination I had gathered round the scene, its appalling terrors, its soul-subduing beauty, 
power and height, and velocity and immensity, were all diminished in eflect, or wholly lost.</p> <!-- Horizontal **** -->
<p>I was quite silent—my very soul sunk within me; On seeing my disappointment (written, I suppose, most 
legibly in my countenance) my companion began to comfort me, by telling me of all those who had been 
disappointed on the first view of <placeName>Niagara</placeName>, and had confessed it. I <hi rend="italics">did</hi> confess; but I was not to be 
comforted. We held on our way to the <placeName>Clifton hotel</placeName>, at the foot of the hill; most desolate it looked 
with its summer verandahs and open balconies cumbered up with snow, and hung round with icicles—its 
forlorn, empty rooms, broken windows, and dusty dinner tables. The poor people who kept the house in 
winter had gathered themselves for warmth and comfort into a little kitchen, and when we made our 
appearance, stared at us with a blank amazement, which showed what a rare thing was the sight of a <roleName>visitor</roleName> 
at this season.</p> 
<p>While the horses were cared for, I went up into the highest balcony to command a better
   view of the cataracts; a little <trait type="ethnicity"><label>Yankee boy</label></trait>, with a shrewd, sharp face, and twinkling black eyes, acting 
   as my <roleName>gentleman usher</roleName>. As I stood gazing on the scene which seemed to enlarge upon my vision, the little
<pb n="69"/><seg type="pagenumber">67</seg>fellow stuck his hands into his pockets, and looking up in ray face, said,</p> 
         <p>"You be from the <placeName>old country</placeName>, I reckon?"</p> 
         <p>"Yes."</p> 
         <p>"Out over there, beyond the sea?" </p>
         <p>"Yes." </p>
         <p>"And did you come all that way across the sea for these here <placeName>Falls</placeName>?"</p> 
         <p>"Yes." </p>
         <p>"My!!" Then after a long pause, and eyeing me with a most comical 
            expression of impudence and fun, he added, "Now, do <hi rend="italics">you</hi> know what them 'ere birds are, out yonder?" 
pointing to a number of gulls which were hovering and sporting amid the spray, rising and sinking and 
wheeling around, appearing to delight in playing on the verge of this "hell of waters" and almost 
dipping their wings into the foam. My eyes were, in truth, fixed on these fair, fearless creatures, 
and they had suggested already twenty fanciful similitudes, when I was roused by this question.</p> 
         <p>"Those birds?" said I. "Why, what are they?"</p> 
         <p>"Why, them's eagle!"</p> 
         <p>"Eagles?" it was impossible to help laughing.</p> 
         <p>"Yes," said the urchin sturdily; "and I guess you have none of them in the old country?"</p> 
         <p>"Not many eagles, my boy; but plenty of <hi rend="italics">gulls</hi>!" and I gave him a pretty considerable pinch by the 
   ear.</p> 
<p>"Ay!" said he, laughing; "well now, you be dreadful smart—smarter than many folks that come 
   here!"</p>
         <pb n="70"/><p><seg type="pagenumber">68</seg></p><p>We now prepared to walk to the <placeName>Crescent fall</placeName>, and I bound some crampons to my feet, like those they 
            use among the <placeName>Alps</placeName>, without which I could not for a moment have kept my footing on the frozen surface 
            of the snow. As we approached the <placeName>Table Rock</placeName>, the whole scene assumed a wild and wonderful magnificence; 
down came the dark-green waters, hurrying with them over the edge of the precipice enormous blocks of ice 
brought down from <placeName>Lake Erie</placeName>. On each side of the <placeName>Falls</placeName>, from the ledges and overhanging cliffs, were 
suspended huge icicles, some twenty, some thirty feet in length, thicker than the body of a man, and 
in color of a paly green, like the glaciers of the <placeName>Alps</placeName>; and all the crags below, which projected 
from the boiling eddying waters, were incrusted, and in a manner built round with ice, which had formed 
into immense crystals, like basaltic columns, such as I have seen in the pictures of <placeName>Staffa</placeName> and the 
            <placeName>Giant's Causeway</placeName>; and every tree, and leaf, and branch, fringing the rocks and ravines, were wrought 
            in ice. On them, and on the wooden buildings erected near the <placeName>Table Rock</placeName>, the spray from the cataract 
had accumulated and formed into the most beautiful crystals and tracery work; they looked like houses 
of glass, welted and moulded into regular ornamental shapes, and hung round with a rich fringe of icy 
points. Wherever we stood we were on unsafe ground, for the snow, when heaped up as now to the height 
of three or four feet, frequently slipped in masses from the bare rock, and on its surface the spray, 
for ever falling, was converted into a sheet of ice, smooth, compact, and
            <pb n="71"/><seg type="pagenumber">69</seg>glassy, on which I could not have stood a moment without my <hi rend="italics">crampons</hi>. It was very fearful, and yet I 
            could not tear myself away, but remained on the <placeName>Table Rock</placeName>, even on the very edge of it, till a kind 
of dreamy fascination came over me; the continuous thunder, and might and movement of the lapsing 
waters, held all my vital spirits bound up as by a spell. Then, as at last I turned away, the descending 
sun broke out, and an Iris appeared below the <trait type="ethnicity"><label>American Fall</label></trait>, one extremity resting on a snow mound; and 
motionless there it hung in the midst of restless terrors, its beautiful but rather pale hues contrasting 
with the death-like colorless objects around; it reminded me of the faint ethereal smile of a dying 
martyr.</p> 
<p>We wandered about for nearly four hours, and then returned to the hotel: there my good-natured 
   <roleName>escort</roleName> from <placeName>Toronto</placeName>, <persName>Mr. Campbell</persName>, was waiting to conduct us to his house, which is finely situated on 
an eminence not far from the great cataract. We did not know, till we arrived there, that the young and 
lovely <roleName type="family">wife</roleName> of our <roleName>host</roleName> had been confined only the day before. This event had been concealed from us, 
lest we should have some scruples about accepting hospitality under such circumstances; and, in truth, 
I <hi rend="italics">did</hi> feel at first a little uncomfortable, and rather <hi rend="italics">de trop</hi>; but the genuine kindness of our 
reception soon overcame all scruples: we were made welcome, and soon felt ourselves so; and, for my 
own part, I have always sympathies ready for such occasions, and shared very honestly in the grateful joy 
of these kind people. After dinner I
   <pb n="72"/><seg type="pagenumber">70</seg>went up into the room of the <roleName>invalid</roleName>—a little nest of warmth and comfort; and though the roar of the 
neighboring cataract shook the house as with a universal tremor, it did not quite overpower the soft 
voice of the weak but happy <roleName type="family">mother</roleName>, nor even the feeble wail of the <roleName>new-born babe</roleName>, as I took it in my 
arms with a whispered blessing, and it fell asleep in my lap. Poor little thing!—it was an awful sort 
of lullaby, that ceaseless thunder of the mighty waters ever at hand, yet no one but myself seemed to heed, 
or even to hear it; such is the force of custom, and the power of adaptation even in our most delicate 
organs.</p> 
         <p>To sleep at the hotel was impossible, and to intrude ourselves on the <persName>Campbells</persName> equally so. 
            It was near midnight when we mounted our sleigh to return to the town of <persName>Niagara</persName>, and, as I remember, 
I did not utter a word during the whole fourteen miles. The air was still, though keen, the snow lay 
around, the whole earth seemed to slumber in a ghastly, calm repose; but the heavens were wide awake. 
There the Aurora Borealis was holding her revels, and dancing and flashing, and varying through all shapes 
and all hues—pale amber, rose tint, blood red—and the stars shone out with a fitful, restless brilliance; 
and every now and then a meteor would shoot athwart the skies, or fall to earth, and all around me was wild, 
and strange, and exciting—more like a fever dream than a reality.</p> 
<p>To-day I am suffering, as might be expected, with pain and stiffness, unable to walk across the room; but the pain will pass: and on the 
whole I am glad
   <pb n="73"/><seg type="pagenumber">71</seg>I have made this excursion. <placeName>The Falls</placeName> did not make on my mind the impression I had anticipated, perhaps 
   for that reason, even because I had <hi rend="italics">anticipated</hi> it. Under different circumstances it might have been 
   otherwise; but <q>"it was sung to me in my cradle,"</q> as the <trait type="ethnicity"><label>Germans</label></trait> say,* that I should live to be 
   disappointed—even in the <placeName>Falls of Niagara</placeName>.</p>
         <p><placeName>Toronto</placeName>, <date when="1837-02-07">February 7</date>.</p> 
         <p><persName>Mr. B.</persName> gave me a seat in his sleigh, and after a rapid and very pleasant journey, 
            during which I gained a good deal of information, we reached <placeName>Toronto</placeName> yesterday morning.</p> 
            <p>The road was the same as before—with one deviation however—it was found expedient to cross <placeName>Burlington Bay</placeName> on the 
ice, about seven miles over, the lake beneath being twenty, and five-and-twenty fathoms in depth. It 
was ten o'clock at night, and the only light was that reflected from the snow. The beaten track, from 
which it is not safe to deviate, was very narrow, and a man, in the worst, if not the last stage of 
intoxication, noisy and brutally reckless, was driving before us in a sleigh. All this, with the 
novelty of the situation, the tremendous cracking of the ice at every instant, gave me a sense of 
apprehension just sufficient to be exciting, rather 
               <seg type="footnote">"So war mir's in der Wiege gesungen," is a common phrase in the <placeName>North of Germany</placeName>
   to express something to which we are seemingly predestined.</seg>
<pb n="74"/><seg type="pagenumber">72</seg>than very unpleasant, though I will confess to a feeling of relief when we were once more on the solid earth.</p> 
         <p><persName>B.</persName> is said to be a hard, active, clever, practical man. I liked him, and thought him intelligent and 
            good-natured: we had much talk. Leaving his <roleName>servant</roleName> to drive, he would jump down, stand poised upon 
one of the runners, and, thus gliding smoothly along, we conversed.</p> 
<p>It is a remarkable fact, with which 
you are probably acquainted, that when one growth of timber is cleared from the land, another of 
quite a different species springs up spontaneously in its place. Thus, the oak or the beech succeeds 
to the pine, and the pine to the oak or maple. This is not accounted for, at least I have found no 
one yet who can give me a reason for it. We passed by a forest lately consumed by fire, and I asked why, 
in clearing the woods, they did not leave groups of the finest trees, or even single trees, here and 
there, to embellish the country? But it seems that this is impossible—for the trees thus left 
standing, when deprived of the shelter and society to which they have been accustomed, uniformly 
perish—which, for mine own poor part, I thought very natural.</p> 
         <p>A <trait type="ethnicity"><label>Canadian <roleName>settler</roleName></label></trait> <hi rend="italics">hates</hi> a tree, regards
it as his natural enemy, as something to be dostroyed, eradicated, annihilated by all and any means. 
The idea of useful or ornamental is seldom associated here even with the most magnificent timber trees, 
such as among the <trait type="ethnicity"><label>Druids</label></trait> had been consecrated, and among the <trait type="ethnicity"><label>Greeks</label></trait> would have sheltered oracles and
<pb n="75"/><seg type="pagenumber">73</seg>votive temples. The beautiful faith which assigned to every tree of the forest its guardian nymph, to 
every leafy grove its tutelary divinity, would find no votaries here. Alas! for the Dryads and Hamadryads 
of <placeName>Canada</placeName>! 
There are two principal methods of killing trees in this country, besides the quick, unfailing 
destruction of the axe; the first by setting fire to them, which sometimes leaves the root uninjured to 
rot gradually and unseen, or be grubbed up at leisure, or, more generally, there remains a visible fragment 
of a charred and blackened stump, deformed and painful to look upon; the other method is slower, but even 
more effectual; a deep gash is cut through the bark into the stem, quite round the bole of the tree. 
This prevents the circulation of the vital juices, and by degrees the tree droops and dies. This is 
technically called <hi rend="italics">ringing</hi> timber. Is not this like the two ways in which a woman's heart may be killed 
in this world of ours—by passion and by sorrow? But better far the swift fiery death than this <q>"ringing,"</q>
as they call it!</p> <!-- Horizontal line -->

         <p>There is no <hi rend="italics">society</hi> in <placeName>Toronto</placeName>," is what I hear repeated all around me—even by those 
who compose the only society we have. "But," you will say, "what could be expected in a remote town, 
which <date when="1797">forty years ago</date> was an uninhabited swamp, and <date when="1817">twenty years</date> ago only began to exist?" I really <seg type="pagesignature"> vol. I 7</seg>
            <pb n="76"/><seg type="pagenumber">74</seg>do not know what I expected, but I will tell you what I did <hi rend="italics">not</hi> expect. I did not expect to find here 
in this new capital of a new country, with the boundless forest within half a mile of us on almost 
every side—concentrated as it were the worst evils of our old and most artificial social system at home, 
with none of its <hi rend="italics">agrémens</hi>, and none of its advantages. <placeName>Toronto</placeName> is like a fourth or fifth rate 
provincial town, with the pretensions of a capital city. We have here a petty colonial oligarchy, 
a self-constituted aristocracy, based upon nothing real, nor even upon any thing imaginary; and we 
have all the mutual jealousy and fear, and petty gossip, and mutual meddling and mean rivalship, which 
are common in a small society of which the members are well known to each other, a society composed, 
like all societies, of many heterogeneous particles; but as these circulate within very confined limits, 
there is no getting out of the way of what one most dislikes: we must necessarily hear, see, and passively 
endure much that annoys and disgusts any one accustomed to the independence of a large and liberal society, 
or the ease of <trait type="ethnicity"><label>continental life</label></trait>. It is curious enough to see how quickly a new fashion, or a new folly, is 
            imported from the <placeName>old country</placeName>, and with what dilficulty and delay a new idea finds its way into the heads 
of the people, or a new book into their hand. Yet, in the midst of all this, I cannot but see that good 
spirits and corrective principles are at work; that progress is making: though the march of intellect 
be not here in double quick
            <pb n="77"/><seg type="pagenumber">75</seg>time, as in <placeName>Europe</placeName>, it does not absolutely stand stock-still.</p> 
            <p>There reigns here a hateful factious spirit 
in political matters, but for the present no public or patriotic feeling, no recognition of general 
or generous principles of policy: as yet I have meet with none of these. <placeName>Canada</placeName> is a colony, not a <hi rend="italics">country</hi>; 
it is not yet identified with the dearest affections and associations, remembrances, and hopes of its 
inhabitants: it is to them an adopted, not a real mother. Their love, their pride, are not for poor 
               <placeName>Canada</placeName>, but for high and happy <placeName>England</placeName>; but a few more generations must change all this.</p> 
         <p>We have here <roleName>Tories</roleName>, <roleName>Whigs</roleName>, and <orgName>Radicals</orgName>, so called; but these words do not signify exactly what we mean by the same 
designations at home.</p> 
         <p>You must recollect that the first <roleName>settlers</roleName> in <placeName>Upper Canada</placeName> were those who were 
            obliged to fly from the <placeName>United States</placeName> during the revolutionary war, in consequence of their attachment 
            to the <trait type="ethnicity"><label>British government</label></trait>, and the <roleName>soldiers</roleName> and <roleName>non-commissioned officers</roleName> who had fought during the 
war. These were recompensed for their losses, sufferings, and services, by grants of land in <placeName>Upper 
   Canada</placeName>. Thus the very first elements out of which our social system was framed, were repugnance and contempt 
            for the new institutions of the <placeName>United States</placeName>, and a dislike to the people of that country—a very natural 
result of foregoing causes; and thus it has happened that the slightest tinge of democratic, or even 
liberal principles in politics, was for a long time a sufficient impeachment of the loyalty, a stain upon the 
            <pb n="78"/><seg type="pagenumber">76</seg>personal character, of those who held them. The <roleName>Tories</roleName> have therefore been hitherto the influential party; 
in their hands we find the government patronage, the principal offices, the sales and grants of land, 
for a long series of years.</p> 
<p>Another party, professing the same boundless loyalty to the mother country, 
   and the same dislike for the principles and institutions of their <trait type="ethnicity"><label>Yankee neighbors</label></trait>, may be called the 
   <roleName>Whigs of <placeName>Upper Canada</placeName></roleName>; these look with jealousy and scorn on the power and prejudices of the <roleName>Tory 
      families</roleName>, and insist on the necessity of many reforms in the colonial government. Many of these are 
   <roleName>young men of talent</roleName>, and <roleName>professional men</roleName>, who find themselves shut out from what they regard as their 
fair proportion of social consideration and influence, such as, in a small society like this, their
superior education and character ought to command for them.</p> 
<p>Another set are the <orgName>Radicals</orgName>, whom I generally 
hear mentioned as "those scoundrels," or "those rascals," or with some epithet expressive of the utmost 
contempt and disgust. They are those who wish to see this couutry erected into a republic, like the <placeName>United 
   States</placeName>. A few among them are <roleName>men of talent and education</roleName>, but at present they are neither influential nor formidable.</p> 
<p>There is among all parties a general tone of complaint and discontent—a mutual distrust—a 
languor and supineness—the causes of which I cannot as yet understand. Even those who are enthusiastically 
   <trait type="ethnicity"><label>British in heart and feeling</label></trait>, who sincerely believe that it is the true interest of the colony to remaian
   <pb n="79"/><seg type="pagenumber">77</seg>under the control of the <placeName>mother country</placeName>, are as discontented as the rest: they bitterly denounce the 
   ignorance of the <roleName>colonial officials</roleName> at home, with regard to the true interests of the country: they 
ascribe the want of capital for improvement on a large scale to no mistrust in the resources of the 
country, but to a want of confidence in the measures of the government, and the security of property.</p> 
<p>In order to understand something of the feelings which prevail here, you must bear in mind the distinction 
   between the two provinces of <placeName>Upper and Lower Canada</placeName>. The project of uniting them once more into one legislature,
with a central metropolis, is most violently opposed by those whose personal interests and convenience would 
suffer materially by a change in the seat of government. I have heard some persons go so far as to declare, 
that if the union of the two provinces were to be established by law, it were sufficient to absolve a man 
from his allegiance. On the other hand, the measure has powerful advocates in both provinces.* It seems, 
on looking over the map of this vast and magnificent country, and reading its whole history, that the political 
division into five provinces* each with its independent <roleName>governor</roleName> and <roleName>legislature</roleName>, its separate correspondence 
   with the <placeName>Colonial-office</placeName>, its local laws, and local taxation, must certainly add to the amount of colonial 
patronage, and perhaps
<seg type="footnote">A very clever paper on this subject
   was published in the <placeName>Quebec</placeName> Mercury, <date>Sept. 14th, 1837.</date></seg>

   <pb n="80"/><seg type="pagenumber">78</seg>render more secure the subjection of the whole to the <trait type="ethnicity"><label>British crown</label></trait>; but may it not also have perpetuated local
distinctions and jealousies—kept alive divided interests, narrowed the resources, and prevented the 
improvement of the country on a large and general scale?</p> 
         <p>But I had better stop here, ere I get beyond my 
            depth. I am not one of those who opine sagely, that <roleName>women</roleName> have nothing to do with politics. On the contrary;
            but I do seriously think, that no one, be it <roleName>man</roleName> or <roleName>woman</roleName>, ought to talk, much less write, on what they do 
not understand. Not but that I have my own ideas on these matters, though we were never able to make out, 
either to my own satisfaction or to yours, whether I am a <roleName>Whig</roleName>, or <roleName>Tory</roleName>, or <roleName>Radical</roleName>. In politics I acknowledge 
but two parties—those who hope and those who fear. In morals, but two parties—those who lie and those 
who speak truth: and all the world I divide into those who love, and those who hate. This comprehensive 
arrangement saves me a vast deal of trouble, and answers all my own purposes to admiration.</p> <!-- Horizontal line -->

         <p><placeName>Toronto</placeName> is, as a residence, worse and better than other small communities—worse in so much 
            as it is remote from all the best advantages of a high <trait type="ethnicity"><label>state of civilization</label></trait>, while it is infected by all 
its evils, all its follies; and better, because, besides being a small place, it is a young place; and 
in spite of this affectation of looking back, instead of looking up,
<pb n="81"/><seg type="pagenumber">79</seg>it must advance—it may become the thinking head and beating heart of a nation, great, wise, and happy; 
who knows? And there are moments when, considered under this point of view, it assumes an interest 
even to me; but at present it is in a false position, like that of a youth aping maturity; or rather 
like that of the little boy in <persName>Hogarth</persName>'s picture, dressed in a long-flapped laced waistcoat, ruffles, and 
cocked-hat, crying for bread and butter. With the interminable forests within half a mile of us—the haunt 
of the <trait type="ethnicity"><label>red man</label></trait>, the wolf, the bear—with an absolute want of the means of the most ordinary mental and 
moral development, we have here conventionalism in its most oppressive and ridiculous forms. If I should 
say, that at present the people here want cultivation, want polish, and the means of acquiring either, <hi rend="italics">that</hi> 
is natural—is intelligible—and it were unreasonable to expect it could be otherwise; but if I say they 
want honesty, <hi rend="italics">you</hi> would understand me, <hi rend="italics">they</hi> would not; they would imagine that I accused them of false 
weights and cheating at cards. So far they are certainly <q>"indifferent honest"</q> after a fashion, but never 
did I hear so little truth, nor find so little mutual benevolence. And why is it so?—because in this 
place, as in other small provincial towns, they live under the principle of fear—they are all afraid of 
each other, afraid to be themselves; and where there is much fear, there is little love, and less truth.

         <p>The monotony of this, my most monotonous existence, was fearfully broken last night. I had 
            gone early to my room, and had just rung for my <roleName>maid</roleName>, when I was aware of a strange light flashing through
the atmosphere—a fire was raging in the lower parts of the city. I looked out; there was the full moon, 
brighter than ever she shows her fair face in our dear cloudy <placeName>England</placeName>—bright and calm as you now behold her 
            in the <placeName>Mediterranean</placeName>, looking down upon the snowy landscape, and the icy bay glittered like a sheet of silver; 
and on the other side of the heavens all was terror and tumult—clouds of smoke, mingled with spires of flame, 
rose into the sky. Far off the <roleName>garrison</roleName> was beating to arms—the bells tolling; yet all around there was not 
            a living being to be seen, and the snow-waste was still as death.</p> 
            <p>Fires are not uncommon in <placeName>Toronto</placeName>, where 
the houses are mostly wood; they have generally an alarum once or twice a week, and six or eight houses burned 
in the course of the winter; but it was evident this was of more fearful extent than
               <pb n="83"/><seg type="pagenumber">81</seg>usual. Finding, on inquiry, that all the household had gone off to the scene of action, my own <roleName>maid</roleName> excepted, 
I prepared to follow, for it was impossible to remain here idly gazing on the flames, and listening to the 
distant shouts in ignorance and suspense. The fire was in the principal street, (<placeName>King-street</placeName>,) and five 
houses were burning together. I made my way through the snow-heaped, deserted streets, and into a kind of 
court or garden at the back of the blazing houses. There was a vast and motley pile of household stuff in the
midst, and a poor woman keeping guard over it, nearly up to her knees in the snow. I stood on the top of a 
bedstead, leaning on her shoulder, and thus we remained till the whole row of buildings had fallen in. The 
               <trait type="ethnicity"><label>Irishmen</label></trait> (God bless my countrymen! for in all good—all mischief—all frolic—all danger—they are sure to be 
the first) risked their lives most bravely; their dark figures moving to and fro amid the blazing rafters, 
their fine attitudes, and the recklessness with which they flung themselves into the most horrible situations, 
became at last too fearfully exciting. I was myself so near, and the flames were so tremendous, that one side 
of my face was scorched and blistered.</p> 
<p>All this time, the poor woman on whose shoulder I was leaning, stood 
silent and motionless, gazing with apparent tranquillity on her burning house. I remember saying to her with a 
shudder—"But this is dreadful! to stand by and look on while one's home and property are destroyed!" And 
she replied quietly, "Yes, ma'am ; but I dare say some
   <pb n="84"/><seg type="pagenumber">82</seg>good will come of it. All is for the best, if one knew it; and now <persName>Jemmy</persName>'s safe, I don't care, for the rest." 
   Now <persName>Jemmy</persName> was not her son, as I found, but a poor little <roleName>orphan</roleName>, of whom she took charge.</p> 
   <p>There had been at first a scarcity of water, but a hole being hewed through the ice on the lake, the supply was soon quick and 
plentiful. All would have been well over, if the sudden fall of a stack of chimneys had not caused some 
horrible injuries. One poor boy was killed, and some others maimed—poor <persName>Mr. B.</persName> among the number. After this 
I returned home rather heart-sick, and nigh to the house a sleigh glanced by at a full gallop, on which I 
could just perceive, in the moonlight, the extended form of a man with his hands clenched over his head—as 
in agony, or lifeless.</p> 
<p>Talking this morning of the incidents of last night, several people have attempted to
comfort themselves and me too with the assurance, that whatever might be the private loss or suffering, a fire
was always a <hi rend="italics">public</hi> benefit in <placeName>Toronto</placeName>—a good brick house was sure to arise in the place of a wooden one. It 
may be so—brick houses are better certainly than wooden ones—safer too; but as a general argument, I never 
can bear to think that any public benefit can be based on individual suffering: I hate the doctrine, and 
am not convinced by the logic. In these days of political economy, it is too much a fashion to consider human 
beings only in masses. Wondrous, and vast, and all-important as is this wide frame of human society, with
<pb n="85"/><seg type="pagenumber">83</seg>all its component elements variously blended—all its magnificent destinies—is it more important in the sight
of God, more fearful, more sublime to contemplate, than that mysterious world of powers, and affections, and 
aspirations, which we call the human soul?</p> 
<p>In what regards government and politics, do we not find the interest 
of the many sacrificed to the few; while, in all that regards society, the morals and the happiness of individuals 
are sacrificed to the many? and both are wrong. I never can bring myself to admire a social system, in which 
the honor, rights, or happiness of any individual, though the meanest, is made to yield to a supposed future 
or general good. It is a wicked calculation, and it will be found as inexpedient as it is wicked.</p>

   especial reason to exclaim against this principle. We are told openly by <roleName>moralists</roleName> and <roleName>politicians</roleName>, that it is 
for the general good of society, nay, an absolute necessity, that one-fifth part of our sex should be condemned
as the legitimate prey of the other, predoomed to die in reprobation, in the streets, in hospitals, that the 
virtue of the rest may be preserved, and the <hi rend="italics">pride</hi> and the passions of men both gratified. But I have a bitter 
pleasure in thinking that this most base, most cruel conventional law is avenged upon those who made and uphold 
it; that here the sacrifice of a certain number of one sex to the permitted license of the other is no general 
good, but a general curse—a very ulcer in the bosom of society.</p> 
<p>The subject is a hateful one—more hateful is it
<pb n="86"/><seg type="pagenumber">84</seg>to hear it sometimes alluded to with sneering levity, and sometimes waved aside with a fastidious or arrogant 
prudery. Unless we women take some courage to look upon the evil, and find some help, some remedy within 
ourselves, I know not where it is to come from.</p> 
         <p><persName>F.</persName> told me <date when="1837-02-20">yesterday</date> a story which I must try to note down for 
you, if I can find fit words in which to relate it. It is another proof that the realities of life transcend 
all fiction. I have known—have seen with these mine own eyes, more of tragedy and romance than I would dare to 
reveal—and who has not?</p> 
         <p><persName>F.</persName> told me, that when he was serving in the army in the <placeName>Lower Province</placeName>, a young 
            <roleName>officer</roleName>, one of his own friends, (mentioning his name,) seduced from her parents a very pretty girl, about 
            fifteen or sixteen. <persName>F.</persName> knew something of her family, which was respectable, and tried to save her, but in 
            vain. After some months, the <roleName>officer</roleName> <persName>S.</persName> became tired of his <roleName>victim</roleName>, and made her over to a brother <roleName>officer</roleName>.
            <persName>F.</persName> again interfered, and the poor girl did for a time return to her parents, who gladly and gratefully received
her; but she was spoiled for her home, and her home was spoiled for her; the sources of innocent pleasure were 
poisoned, and why should we wonder and exclaim, if a woman who has once known the flatteries and caresses of love, 
find it hard—most hard—to resign herself to days and nights, solitary, toilsome, joyless, unendeared? After a 
while, the <roleName>colonel of the regiment</roleName> found means to allure her again from her home; he
            <pb n="87"/><seg type="pagenumber">85</seg>became strongly attached to her, she was faithful and devoted to him, and he took her with him to <placeName>England</placeName>.</p> 
         <p>Years had passed away, when <persName>S.</persName>,who had left the army, also returned to <placeName>England</placeName>. While be was roaming about <placeName>London</placeName>, 
amusing himself as young men are wont to do after a long absence from the central mart of pleasure and dissipation,
he betook himself one evening, after a tavern dinner, to some house of infamous resort, and one of the wretched 
   women of the establishment was sent to him as a companion. As she entered the room, <persName>S.</persName> started from the sofa to 
encounter in the impudent, degraded, haggard, tawdry thing before him, the poor child who had been his victim 
in <placeName>Canada</placeName>; but long years of vice and misery had not yet utterly hardened her. They stood face to face for a 
few seconds, and looked in silence upon each other, (and who can tell what in those few seconds may have passed 
through the minds of each?) and then the miserable girl fell senseless on the floor.</p> 
<p>He raised her up, and, in the 
remorse and agony of the moment, offered her all he had in the world;—poor, poor compensation! He urged her 
return to <placeName>Canada</placeName>:—he would pay all her expenses—place her beyond the reach of want—but it was all in vain.</p> 
   <p>After the first burst of feeling was over, the wretched girl shook him from her with sullen scorn and despair, and not 
only refused to return to the home she had disgraced, but even to accept from him any thing whatever—and thus she 
left him. He it was—<hi rend="italics">himself</hi>—who described the scene to <persName>F.</persName> <seg type="pagesignature"> vol. i. 8</seg>
      <pb n="88"/><seg type="pagenumber">86</seg>"Poor fellow!" said <persName>F.</persName>, in conclusion, "he did not recover it for a long time—he felt it very much!"</p> 
         <p>Poor fellow!—and yet he was to be pitied; he did not make the system under which he was educated.</p>
         <p>"What became of <persName>Captain S.</persName>?" I asked.</p> 
         <p>"O, he married well; he is now a very respectable and excellent man—<roleName type="family">father</roleName> of a 
family."</p> 
<p>"He has <roleName type="family">children,</roleName> then?</p> 
         <p>"Yes; several."</p> 
         <p><roleName type="family">"Daughters?"</roleName></p>
         <p>"Yes."</p> 
         <p>"No doubt," thought I, "he will take care of them."</p>
         <p>And yet one word more before I throw down my pen. I have wandered far from the fire in <placeName>King-street</placeName>
            —but no matter.</p> 
            <p>How often, we hear repeated that most false and vulgar commonplace, that the <roleName>rakes</roleName> and 
               <roleName>libertines</roleName> of the other sex are sure to find favor with women—even the most virtuous women! This has been repeated
over and over again by <roleName>wits</roleName> and <roleName>playwrights</roleName> till foolish women take the thing for granted, and foolish men aim at 
such a reputation as a means of pleasing us. О the folly in them—the insult to us! No man ever pleased a woman 
because he was a <roleName>libertine</roleName>. What virtuous woman has the least idea of what a <roleName>libertine</roleName> really is? What fair, 
innocent girl, who hears a very agreeable and perfectly well-bred man stigmatized as such, images the thing to 
herself? Does she know what it means? Can <hi rend="italics">she</hi> follow such a man into his daily life, his bought
<pb n="89"/><seg type="pagenumber">87</seg>pleasures, his shameful haunts? Luckily—or shall I not say unluckily?—she has no knowledge, no conception even, 
of all this. If the truth were laid open to her, how she would shrink away from all contact with such a being, in 
the utter disgust which a pure-hearted and pure-minded being would naturally feel! Her idea of a <roleName>libertine</roleName> is 
about as near the truth as poor <persName>Minna</persName>'s idea of a <roleName>pirate</roleName>. And so that which is the result of the ignorance; thè 
innocence, the purity of women, is oddly enough converted into reproach against us.</p>
<p>No; there is no salvation 
for women but in ourselves: in self-knowledge, self-reliance, self-respect, and in mutual help and pity; no 
good is done by a smiling abuse of the <q>"wicked courses"</q> of men, while we trample into irrecoverable perdition 
the weak and erring of our own sex*
   <seg type="footnote">I cannot forbear quoting here a passage from <persName>Harriet Martineau,</persName>
      printed since this little journal was written: "In the present case, the course to be pursued is to exalt
      the aimsand to strengthen the self-discipline of the whole of society by each one being as good as he can make himself,
      and relying on his own efforts after self-perfection, rather than on any fortunate arrangements of outward social circumstances.

of illness and solitary confinement, I took refuge in another and a higher world, and bring you my ideas thereupon.</p> 
<p>I have been reading over again the Iphigenia, the Tasso, and the Egmont of Goethe. Iphigenia is all repose ; 
Tasso all emotion ; Eg¬ mont all action and passion. Iphigenia rests upon the grace and grandeur of form—it is 
statuesque throughout. Tasso is the strife between the poetic and prosaic nature. Egmont is the working of the 
real ; all here is palpable, practical—even love itself I laid down the Tasso with a depth of emotion which I have
never felt but after reading Hamlet, to which alone I could compare it ; but this is a trage¬ dy profound and 
complete in effect, without the in¬ tervention of any evil principle,, without a dagger, without a death, without 
a tyrant, without a traitor? The truth of Leonora d'Este's character struck me forcibly ; it is true to itself, 
as a character—true to all we know of her history. The shadow which a a hidden love has thrown over the otherwise 
trans¬ parent and crystalline simplicity of her mind is very charming—more charming from the contrast with
<seg type="footnote"><persName>Mademoiselle de l'Espinasse.</persName></seg>
her friend Leonora Sanvitale, who reconciles her¬ self to the project of removing Tasso with exquisite feminine 
subtlety and sentimental cunning. Why do you not finish your translation of the Egmont ? who will ever do it as 
you can ? What deep wisdom, what knowledge of human nature in every scene ! And what can be finer than the two 
female portraits—the imperial, imperious Margaret of Austria, and the plebeian girl, Clärchen ? The character of
Clärchen grows upon me as I study it. Is she not really a Flemish Juliet, in her fond im¬ patience, her wilfulness, 
and the energy of resolve arising out of the strength of passion ? And her tenderness for her poor discarded lover, 
Braken¬ berg, whom she cannot love and cannot hate, is all so womanly natural ! # # # # Iphigenia is an heroic 
tragedy— Tasso, a poetical tragedy ; Egmont, an historical tragedy—Clavigo is what the Germans call a bürgerliche, 
or domestic tragedy (tragédie bourgeoise.) I did not read this play as I read the Tasso, borne aloft into the ideal, 
floating on the wings of enthusiasm between the earth and stars ; but I laid it down with a terrible and profound 
pain —yes, pain ! for it was worse and deeper than mere emotion. Yet it is difficult to speak of Clavigo as a 
work of art. The matter-of- fact simplicity of the plot, the every-day nature of the characters, the prosaic 
sentiments, the deep homely pathos of the situations, are almost too real —they are brought home to our own bosoms, 
our own experience—they are just what, in feeling 8*
most, we can least dare to express, The scene be¬ tween Carlos and Clavigo, in which Carlos dis¬ suades his friend 
from marrying the woman to whom he was engaged, is absolutely wonderful. If Clavigo yielded to any mere persuasion 
or common¬ place arguments, he would be a despicable wretch— i we" should feel no interest about him, and it would 
also belie the intellect with which he is endowed. It is to that intellect, Carlos addresses himself. His arguments, 
under one point of view—that of com¬ mon sense—are unanswerable. His reasoning, springing from conviction, is reason 
itself. What can be more practically wise than his calculations— more undeniably true than his assertions ? His 
rhetoric, dictated as it is by real friendship, and full of fire and animation, is even more overwhelming from its 
sincerity than its eloquence ; and his sar¬ castic observations on poor Marie Beaumarchais, on her want of personal
attractions, her ill-health, her foreign manners ; on the effect she will produce on society as his wife, and the 
clog she must prove to his freedom and ambitious career, are all so well aimed, so well meant, so well founded, that 
far from hating Carlos and despising Clavigo, we are im¬ pressed with a terror, a sympathy, a sort of fearful 
fascination. Every one who reads this play must acknowledge, and with an inward shuddering, that it is possible he 
might have yielded to this conven¬ tional common sense, this worldly logic, even for want of arguments to disprove 
it. The only things left out in the admirable reasonings and calculations of Carlos, are nature and conscience, to 
which, in
their combination, the world have agreed to give the name of Romance. But never yet were the feelings and instincts
of our nature violated with impunity ; never yet was the voice of conscience silenced without retribution. In the 
tragedy, the ca¬ tastrophe is immediate and terrible ; in real life it might come in some other shape, or it might 
come later, but it would come—of that there is no doubt.
February 25. The accusation which has been frequently made against Goethe, that notwithstanding his passionate 
admiration for women, he has throughout his works wilfully and systematically depreciated woman¬ hood, is not just, 
in my opinion. No doubt he is not so universal as Shakspeare, nor so ideal as Schiller ; but though he might have 
taken a more elevated and a more enlarged view of the sex, his portraits of individual women are true as truth it¬ self. 
His idea of women generally was like that entertained by Lord Byron, rather oriental and sul- tanish; he is a 
little of the bashaw persuasion. " Goethe," said a friend of mine who knew him in¬ timately, " had no notion of 
heroic women," (Hel¬ denfrauen,) " in poetry, he thought them unnatural, in history, false. For such delineations 
as Schil¬ ler's Joan of Arc, and Stauffacher's wife (in Wil¬ helm Tell) he had neither faith nor sympathy." His 
only heroic and ideal creation is the Iphige¬ nia, and she is as perfect and as pure as a piece of Greek sculpture. 
I think it a proof that if he did
<pb n="94"/><seg type="pagenumber">92</seg>not understand or like the active heroism of Ama¬ zonian ladies, he had a very sublime idea of the passive heroism 
of female nature. The basis of the character is truth. The drama is the very triumph of unsullied, unflinching 
truth. It has been said, that Goëthe intended this character as a portrait of the Grand Duchess Louise, of Weimar. 
The in¬ tention of the poet remains doubtful ; but it should seem that from the first moment the resemblance was 
generally admitted : and what a glorious com¬ pliment to the Duchess was this acknowledgment ! It was through this 
true-heartedness, this immuta¬ ble integrity in word and deed, and through no shining qualities of mind, or 
blandishments of man¬ ner, that she prevailed over the angry passions, and commanded the respect of Napoleon, 
a man who openly contemned women, but whose instructions to his ambassadors and ministers always ended with 
" Soignez les femmes," a comment of deep import on our false position and fearful power.</p>
<p><date when="1837-02-27">February 27</date>.</p> 
         <p>I have had a visit this morning from a man I must introduce to you more particularly. My friend, 
<persName>Col. F.</persName>, would have pleased me any where, but here he is really invaluable.</p> 
            <p>Do you remember that lyric of <persName>Wordsworth</persName>, "The Reverie of Poor <persName>Susan</persName>," in which he describes the emotions of a poor <roleName>servant-girl</roleName> from the
      <pb n="95"/><seg type="pagenumber">93</seg>country, whose steps are arrested in <placeName>Cheapside</placeName> by the song of a caged bird? 
              <lg> <l>'Tis a note of enchantment—what ails her? she sees</l> 
               <l>A mountain ascending, a vision of trees; </l>
                 <l>And a single small cottage, a nest like a dove's,</l>
                 <l>The one only dwelling on earth that she loves!</l></lg> 
               <l>She looks, and her heart is in heaven!</l></p>
<p>And how near are human hearts allied in all natural instincts and sympathies, and what an unfailing, universal fount of poetry are 
these even in their homeliest forms! <persName>F.</persName> told me to-day, that once, as he was turning down a bye street in this 
little town, he heard somewhere near him the song of the lark. (Now, you must observe, there are no larks in 
<placeName>Canada</placeName> but those which are brought from the <placeName>old country</placeName>.) <persName>F.</persName> shall speak in his own words: "So, ma'am, when I 
heard the voice of the bird in the air, I looked, by the natural instinct, up to the heavens, though I knew it 
could not be there, and then on this side, and then on that, and sure enough at last I saw the little creature 
perched on its sod of turf in a little cage, and there it kept trilling and warbling away, and there I stood 
stock still—listening with my heart. Well, I don't know what it was at all that came over me, but every thing 
seemed to change before my eyes, and it was in poor <placeName>Ireland</placeName> I was again, and my home all about me, and I was 
again a wild slip of a boy, lying on my back on the hill-side above my <roleName type="family">mother</roleName>'s cabin, and watching, as I 
used to do, the lark singing and soaring
<pb n="96"/><seg type="pagenumber">94</seg>over my head, and I straining my eye to follow her till she melted into the blue sky—and there, ma'am —would 
you believe it?—I stood like an old fool listening to the bird's song, lost, as in a dream, and there I think 
I could have stood till this day." And the eyes of the rough <roleName>soldier</roleName> filled with tears, even while he laughed 
at himself, as perfectly unconscious that he was talking poetry, as <persName>Mons. Jourdain</persName> could be that he was talking 
prose.</p> 
         <p><persName>Colonel F.</persName> is a soldier of fortune—which phrase means, in <hi rend="italics">his</hi> case at least, that he owes nothing whatever 
to fortune, but every thing to his own good heart, his own good sense, and his own good sword. He was the son, 
and glories in it, of an <trait type="ethnicity"><label>Irish cotter</label></trait>, on the estate of the <persName>Knight of Glyn</persName>. At the age of fifteen he shouldered 
a musket, and joined a regiment which was ordered to <placeName>Holland</placeName> at the time the <roleName>Duke of York</roleName> was opposed to <persName>Du· 
mourier</persName>. His only reading up to this time had been "The Seven Champions of Christendom," and "The Seven Wise 
Masters." With his head full of these examples of chivalry, he marched to his first battle-field, vowing to 
himself, that if there were a dragon to be fought, or a giant to be defied, he would be their man!—at all events,
he would enact some valorous exploit, some doughty deed of arms, which should astonish the world and dub him 
<roleName>captain</roleName> on the spot. He then described with great humor and feeling his utter astonishment and mortification 
on finding the mechanical slaughter of a modern field of battle so widely different from the picture in his 
fancy;—when he found himself one
<pb n="97"/><seg type="pagenumber">95</seg>of a mass in which the individual heart and arm, however generous, however strong, went for nothing —forced to 
stand still, to fire only by the word of command—the chill it sent to his heart, and his emotions when he saw 
the <roleName>comrade</roleName> at his side fall a quivering corse at his feet—all this he described with a graphic liveliness and 
simplicity which was very amusing. He was afterwards taken <roleName>prisoner</roleName>, and at the time he was so overcome by the
idea of the indignity he had incurred by being captured and stripped, and of the affliction and dishonor that 
would fall on his <roleName type="family">mother</roleName>, that he was tempted to commit suicide in the old <trait type="ethnicity"><label>Roman fashion</label></trait>; but on seeing a <roleName>lieutenant</roleName> 
of his own regiment brought in <roleName>prisoner</roleName>, he thought better of it; a dishonor which the <roleName>lieutenant</roleName> endured with 
philosophy, might, he thought, be borne by a <roleName>subaltern</roleName>, for by this time, at the age of eighteen, he was already 
            <roleName>sergeant</roleName>. </p>
            <p>He was soon afterwards exchanged, and ordered out to <placeName>Canada</placeName> with his regiment, the Forty-ninth. He 
obtained his commission as <roleName>lieutenant</roleName> in the same regiment by mere dint of bravery and talent; but as his pay 
was not sufficient to enable him to live like his brother <roleName>officers</roleName> and purchase his accoutrements, the promotion 
               he bad earned by his good conduct became, for a long time, a source of embarrassment. During the last <trait type="ethnicity"><label>American 
war</label></trait> he performed a most brilliant exploit, for which he received his <roleName>captain</roleName>'s commission on the field. 
Immediately after receiving it, he astonished his <roleName>commander</roleName> by asking leave of absence, although another 
battle was expected in a few days. The request
<pb n="98"/><seg type="pagenumber">96</seg>was, in truth, so extraordinary that <persName>General Sheaffe</persName> hesitated, and at last refused. <persName>F.</persName> said, that if his 
request was granted, he would be again at headquarters within three days; if refused, he would go without 
leave. "For," said he, "I was desperate, and the truth was, ma'am, there was a little girl that I loved, 
and I knew that if I could but marry her before I was killed, and I a <roleName>captain</roleName>, she would have the pension of 
a <roleName>captain's widow</roleName>. It was all I could leave her, and it would have been some comfort to me, though not to her, 
               poor soul!" </p>
<p>Leave of absence was granted; <persName>F.</persName> mounted his horse, rode a hundred and fifty miles in an 
exceedingly short time, married his little girl, and returned the day following to his duties, and to fight 
another battle, in which, however, he was not killed, but has lived to be the <roleName type="family">father</roleName> of a fine family of <roleName type="family">four 
   brave sons and one gentle daughter.</roleName></p> 
   <p>The men who have most interested me through life were all self-educated, 
      and what are called originals. This dear, good <persName>F.</persName> is <hi rend="italics">originalissimo</hi>. Some time ago he amused me, and gave 
me at the same time a most vivid idea of the minor horrors and irremediable mischiefs of war, by a description 
of his being quartered in a church in <placeName>Flanders</placeName>. The <roleName>soldiers</roleName>, on taking possession of their lodging, began by 
breaking open the poor-boxes and ransacking the sacristie. They then broke up the chairs and benches for fires 
to cook their rations, and these not sufficing, the wooden saints and carved altars were soon torn down. Finding
themselves incommoded by the smoke, some of the <roleName>soldiers</roleName> climbed up by
<pb n="99"/><seg type="pagenumber">97</seg>the projecting ornaments and smashed through the windows of rich stained glass to admit the air and let out 
the smoke. The next morning at sunrise they left this sanctuary of religion and art a foul defaced ruin.
A century could not make good again the pollution and spoliation of those few hours.</p> 
<p>"You must not be too 
hard on us poor <roleName>soldiers</roleName>, added <persName>F.</persName>, as if answering to a look, for I did not comment aloud. "I had a sort 
of instinctive perception of the mischief we were doing, but I was certainly the only one; they knew no 
better, and the precarious life of a <roleName>soldier</roleName> gives him the habit of sacrificing every thing to the present 
moment and a certain callousness to the suffering and destruction which, besides that it ministers to the 
immediate want, is out of sight and forgotten the next instant. Why I was not quite so insensible as the 
rest, I cannot tell, unless it was through the goodness of God. When I was a boy, my first feeling, <hi rend="italics"> next to 
my love for my <roleName type="family">mother</roleName></hi>, was gratitude to God for having made me and called me into being out of nothing. My first 
thought was what I could do to please him. Now, in spite of all the <roleName>priest</roleName> might say, I could not perceive that 
   fasting and praying would do <hi rend="italics">Him</hi> any good, so I looked about in the fulness of my heart to see what I <hi rend="italics">could</hi> 
do—and I fancied there was a voice which whispered continually, 'Do good to your <roleName>neighbor</roleName>, do good to your 
   <roleName>neighbor</roleName>!'"</p> 
   <p>With so much overflowing benevolence and fearless energy of character, and all the eccentricity, 
      and sensibility, and poetry, and headlong courage of his country, you cannot wonder that this brave <seg type="pagesignature"> vol. i. 9</seg>
<pb n="100"/><seg type="pagenumber">98</seg>and worthy man interests me; unluckily, I can see him seldom, his life being one of almost unremitting toil.</p>

         <p>In the different branches of art, each artist think« his own the highest, and is filled with the idea 
of all its value and all its capabilities which he under¬ stands best and has most largely studied and de¬ veloped. 
" But," says Dr. Chalmers, "we must take the testimony of each man to the worth of that which he does know, and 
reject the testimony of each to the comparative worthlessness of that which he does not know." For it is not, 
generally speaking, that he overrates his own particular walk of art from over-enthusi¬ asm, (no art,. when 
considered separately, as a means of human delight and improvement, can be overrated,) but such a one-sided artist
underrates from ignorance the walks of others which diverge from his own. Of all artists, musicians are most 
exclusive in de¬ votion to their own art, and in the want of sympathy, if not absolute contempt, for other arts. 
A painter has more sympathies with a musician, than a musi¬ cian with a painter. Vernet used to bring his easel 
into Pergolesi's room, to paint beside his harpsi- cord, and used to say that he owed some of hi» finest skies to
the inspired harmonies of his friend.
Pergolesi never felt, perhaps, any harmonies but those of his own delicious art. " Aspasia, he who loves not music 
is a beast of one species, and he who overloves it, is a beast of another, whose brain is smaller than a nightingale's, 
and his heart than that of a lizard !" I refer you forthe rest to a striking passage in Lander's " Peri¬ cles and 
Aspasia," containing a most severe philip¬ pic, not only against the professors, but the profes¬ sion of music, 
and which concludes very aptly, " Panenus said this : let us never believe a word of it!" It is too true that some 
excellent musicians have been ignorant, and sensual, and dissipated, but there are sufficient exceptions to the 
sweeping cen¬ sure of Panenus to show that " imprudence, intem¬ perance, and gluttony," do not always, or necessa¬ rily,
" open their channels into the sacred stream of music." Musicians are not selfish, careless, sensual, ignorant, 
because they are musicians, but because, from a defective education, they are nothing else. The German musicians 
are generally more moral and more intellectual men than English or Italian musicians, and hence their music has 
taken a higher flight, is more intellectual than the music of other countries. Music as an art has not degraded 
them, but they have elevated music. It is impeaching the goodness of the beneficent Creator to deem that moral 
evil can be inseparably connected with any of the fine arts—least of all with music—the soul of the physical, 
as love is of the moral, universe. The most accomplished and intellectual musician
I ever met with is Felix Mendelsohn. I do not re¬ collect if it were himself or some one else who told me of a
letter which Carl von Weber had addressed to him, warning him that he never could attain the highest honors in
his profession without cultivating the virtues and the decencies of life. "A great artist," said Weber, "^ught
to be a good man." While I am " i' the vein," I must give you a few more musical reminiscences before my fingers 
are quite frozen. I had once some conversation with Thalberg and Felix Mendelsohn, on the unmeaning names which 
musicians often give to their works, as Concerto in F, Concerto in B b, First Symphony, Second Sym¬ phony, &amp;c.
Mendelsohn said, that although in almost every case the composer might have a lead¬ ing idea, it would be often 
difficult, or even impos¬ sible, to give any title sufficiently comprehensive to convey the same idea or feeling 
to the mind of the hearer. But music, except to musicians, can only give ideas, or rather raise images, by 
association ; it can give the pleasure which the just accordance of musical sounds must give to sensitive ears, 
but the associated ideas or images, if any, must be quite accidental. Haydn, we are told, when he sat down to 
compose, used first to invent a story in his own fancy—a regular succession of imaginary inci¬ dents and feelings—
to which he framed or suited the successive movements (motivi) of his concerto. Would it not have been an advantage 
if Hayda could have given to his composition such a title ae
would have pitched the imagination of the listener at once upon the same key ? Mendelsohn himself has done this in 
the pieces which he has entitled " Overture to Melusina," " Overture to the He¬ brides," "Meeres Stille und 
Glückliche Fahrt, "The Brook," and others—which is better surely than Sonata No. 1, Sonata No. 2. Take the Melusina, 
for example ; Is there not in the sentiment of the music, all the sentiment of the beautiful old fairy tale ?
—first, in the flowing, intermingling harmony, we have the soft elemental delicacy of the water nymph ; then,
the gushing of fountains, the undu¬ lating waves ; then the martial prowess of the knightly lover, and the 
splendor of chivalry prevail¬ ing over the softer and more ethereal nature ; and then, at last, the dissolution 
of the charm ; the ebb¬ ing, fainting, and failing away into silence of the beautiful water spirit. You will say 
it might answer just as well for Ondine ; but this signifies little, provided we have our fancy pitched to certain 
poetical associations pre-existing in the composer's mind. Thus, not only poems, but pictures and sta¬ tues, 
might be set to music. I suggested to Thal- berg as a subject the Aurora of Guido. It should begin with a slow,
subdued, and solemn movement, to express the slumbrous softness ofthat dewy hour which precedes the coming of 
the day, and which in the picture broods over the distant landscape, still wrapt in darkness and sleep; then the 
stealing upwards of the gradual dawn ; the brightening, the quickening of all life ; the awakening of the birds, 
the burst of the sunlight, the rushing of the steeds
of Hyperion through the sky, the aerial dance of" the Hours, and the whole concluding with a mag¬ nificent choral 
song of triumph and rejoicing sent up from universal nature. And then in the same spirit—no, in his own grander 
spirit—I would have Mendelsohn improvi¬ ser the Laocoon. There would be the pomp and procession of the sacrifice
on the sea-shore; the flowing in of the waves ; the two serpents which come gliding on their foamy crests, 
wreathing, and rearing, and undulating; the horror, the lamenta¬ tion, the clash of confusion, the death struggle, 
and, after a deep pause, the wail of lamentation, the funereal march ; the whole closing with a hymn to Apollo.
Can you not just imagine such a piece of music, and composed by Mendelsohn ? and can you not fancy the possibility 
of setting to music in the same manner, Raffaelle's Cupi and Psyche, or his Galatea, or the group of the Niobe ? 
Niobe would be a magnificent subject either for a concerto, or for a kind of mythological oratorio.
March 2. Turning over Boswell to-day, I came upon this paseage : Johnson says, " I do not commend a so¬ ciety where 
there is an agreement that what would not otherwise be fair shall be fair ; but I maintain that an individual of any
society who practises what is allowed, is not dishonest." What say you to this reasoning of our great mo-
ralist ? Does it not reduce the whole moral law to something merely conventional ? In another place, Dr. 
Johnson asks, " What pro¬ portion does climate bear to the complex system of human life ?" I shiver while 
I answer, " A good deal, my dear Doctor, to some individuals, and yet more to whole races of men." He says 
afterwards, " I deal more in notions than in facts." And so do I, it seems. He talks of " men being held 
down in conversation by the presence of women"— held up, rather, where moral feeling is concerned ; and if
held down where intellect and social interests are concerned, then so much the worse for such a state of 
society. Johnson knew absolutely nothing about women ; witness that One assertion, among others more in¬ sulting,
that it is matter of indifference to a woman whether her husband be faithful or not. He says, in another place, "
If we men require more perfection from women than from ourselves, it is doing them honor." Indeed ! If, in 
exacting from us more perfection, you do not allow us the higher and nobler nature, you do us not honor but 
gross injustice ; and if you do allow us the higher nature, and yet regard us as subject and inferior, then 
the injustice is the greater. There, Doctor, is a dilemma for you. Of all our modern authors, Coleridge best
under¬ stood the essential nature of women, and has said the truest and most beautiful things of our sex 
gene¬ rally ; and of all our modern authors, Hazlitt was
most remarkable for his utter ignorance of women, generally and individually. Charles Lamb, of all the men 
I ever talked to, had the most kindly, the most compassionate, the most reverential feelings towards woman ; 
but he did not, like Coleridge, set forth these feelings with elaborate eloquence—they came gushing out of 
his heart and stammering from his tongue—clothed sometimes in the quaintest disguise of ironical abuse, and 
sometimes in words which made the tears spring to one's eyes. He seemed to under¬ stand us not as a poet, 
nor yet as a man of the world ; but by the unerring instinct of the most loving and benevolent of hearts. 
When Coleridge said antithetically, " that it was the beauty of a woman's character to be character¬ less,"
I suppose it is as if he had said, " It is the beauty of the diamond to be colorless ;" for he in¬ stances 
Ophelia and Desdemona ; and though they are colorless in their pure, transparent simplicity, they are as 
far as possible from characterless, for in the very quality of being colorless consists the cha¬ racter. 
Speaking of Coleridge reminds me that it was from Ludwig Tieck I first learned the death ofthis wonderful man ;
and as I, too, had " sat at the feet of Gamaliel and heard his words," the news struck me with a solemn sorrow. 
I remember that Tieck, in announcing the death of Coleridge, said, in his impressive manner, " A great spirit 
has passed from the world, and the world knew him not."
<pb n="107"/><seg type="pagenumber">105</seg>There are two ladies in Toronto who have con¬ servatories, a proof of advancing wealth, and civi¬ lization, and

<p>Yesterday, (<date when="1837-03-04">March 4th</date>,) our provincial parliament was prorogued by the <roleName>governor in state</roleName>, and I had the honor of 
   <hi rend="italics">assisting</hi>, as the <trait type="ethnicity"><label>French</label></trait> say, on that important occasion.</p> 
         <p>Now you would not ask me, nor do I feel inclined, to 
encumber my little note-book (consecrated to far different purposes, far different themes) with information 
to be obtained in every book of travels and statistics; but it is just possible that you <hi rend="italics">may</hi> know as little of
our political constitution and forms of proceeding as I did before my arrival in <placeName>Upper Canada</placeName>, and I wish to make 
the scene of yesterday as intelligible and as interesting to you as I can, so I will give you, in as few words as 
possible, a sketch of our state machinery.</p> 
<p>I have mentioned to you (I believe) that the division of the <placeName>province
of Quebec</placeName> into <placeName>Upper and Lower Canada</placeName> took place in <date>1791</date>; at that time a
<pb n="108"/><seg type="pagenumber">106</seg>chartered constitution and a separate executive and legislative government were conferred on each province: 
a measure well intended, doubtless, but of which the wisdom was more than doubtful, when we consider the results.</p> 
<p>Our constitution of <placeName>Upper Canada</placeName> seems, at first view, that of the <placeName>mother country</placeName> in miniature, and identical with
it. For instance, we have, as the head of our executive, a <roleName>governor</roleName>, subject, in his military capacity, to the 
<roleName>governor-in-chief</roleName> of <placeName>Lower Canada</placeName>, but in all other respects dependent only on the government at home, assisted 
by an executive council appointed by himself; and we have a legislature composed of a legislative council, 
nominated by the government, and a <orgName>house of assembly</orgName> delegated by the people. These different branches seem to 
represent, not unfitly, the <roleName>sovereign</roleName>, the <roleName>cabinet of ministers</roleName>, the <roleName>House of Lords</roleName>, and the <roleName>House of Commons</roleName>, 
in <placeName>England</placeName>.</p> 
         <p>But there are some important distinctions which tend to secure the dependence of the provincial 
            legislature on the executive government at home; for I do not know that our parliament has hitherto <hi rend="italics"> legislated</hi> 
for the colonies.</p> 
<p>When <persName>Sir Francis Head</persName> arrived here the executive council consisted of five; he added three to 
the number, who were noted <roleName>Reformers</roleName>. About three weeks afterwards this executive council addressed to the <roleName>governor</roleName> 
a document, in which they assumed as their right precisely the same powers and responsibilities as those of the 
<roleName>cabinet ministers</roleName> at home, alleging, that although nominated by the <roleName>governor</roleName>,
<pb n="109"/><seg type="pagenumber">107</seg>they hold themselves responsible to the will of the people.</p>
         <p>To which document <persName>Sir Francis</persName> replied to this effect— 
"that though the constitution of the colony resembled, it was not to be considered as identical with, the constitution 
of the <placeName>mother country</placeName>:—that if the <roleName>lieutenant-governor</roleName> stood in place of the <roleName>sovereign</roleName>—if, like the <roleName>sovereign</roleName>,
            he could <hi rend="italics">do no wrong</hi>, then it would be evident that a <roleName>ministry</roleName>, an <roleName>executive council</roleName>, or some other body of men, 
should be appointed, who might be responsible to the country for their conduct. But this was not the case. The 
<roleName>lieutenant-governor</roleName> was delegated by the <roleName>king</roleName>, not as the <roleName>representative</roleName>, but as the responsible <roleName>minister of 
the sovereign</roleName>, subject to impeachment for neglecting the interests of the people, and liable to immediate recall;
and that, under such circumstances, to render the <roleName>lieutenant-governor</roleName> responsible for the acts of an 
<roleName>executive council</roleName>, which was responsible only to the people, was a manifest injustice, as well as an anomaly."</p> 
<p>All which seems to me a very clear case as thus stated. The <roleName>governor</roleName> also denied not only any right or power of 
his own to alter one letter or iota of the constitution, but all power in the united legislature of <placeName>Upper 
Canada</placeName> to alter or improve the political constitution of the country, as by law established, this power resting
only with the executive in <placeName>England</placeName>. From all which it appears, as far as I can understand, that the government
of this province is not derived from the people who inhabit it, nor responsible to them nor their delegates.</p>
<pb n="110"/><p><seg type="pagenumber">108</seg></p><p>Immediately on receiving this answer, the six <roleName>councillors</roleName> who had presented the document or remonstrance 
above-mentioned, resigned their seats in the council, and <persName>Sir Francis</persName> immediately appointed four others. The 
   <roleName>president of the executive council</roleName>—that is, the <roleName><hi rend="italics">Premier</hi></roleName> of our cabinet of ministers—is <persName>Mr. Sullivan</persName>. The <roleName>legislative
      council</roleName> varies in number: at present there are, I believe, thirty members. Of these, twenty-one are <trait type="ethnicity"><label>Scotch and
         Canadians</label></trait>, and nine <trait type="ethnicity"><label>English</label></trait>, <trait type="ethnicity"><label>Irish</label></trait>, and <trait type="ethnicity"><label>Americans</label></trait>. They represent the <roleName>aristocracy</roleName> of the country, but differ from 
the <roleName>House of Lords</roleName>, in not being herereditary; they are nominated for life by the <roleName>governor</roleName>. The <roleName>speaker</roleName> is the 
<persName>Chief Justice Robinson</persName>, a <roleName>Tory</roleName> in politics, and a very able and accomplished man.</p> 
   <p>The <orgName>house of assembly</orgName> consists 
of the delegates of the people, the number increasing with the population. As soon as the number of <roleName>inhabitants</roleName> 
in a town or country amounts to a certain number fixed by law, they have the right of choosing one or two <roleName>representatives</roleName> 
in parliament. The <orgName>house of assembly</orgName> consisted, in <date>1831</date>, of about forty members. At present there are twenty-two
counties which send each two members to parliament; three counties which send only one member; and the four ridings
of York, and the four ridings of Lincoln, each one member; and seven towns each one member: in all sixty-two members. 
Of these, forty-four are <roleName>Conservative members</roleName>, and eighteen are <roleName>Reformers</roleName>. In the former <orgName>house of assembly</orgName>, dissolved 
by <persName>Sir Francis Head</persName> in <date>1836</date>, the majority were <orgName>Radicals</orgName>,
      <pb n="111"/><seg type="pagenumber">109</seg>or opposed to the <trait type="ethnicity"><label>British supremacy</label></trait>. The best speakers on the <roleName>Conservative</roleName> side are, <persName>Hagerman</persName>, the <roleName>Solicitor-general</roleName>,
* a <roleName>Tory</roleName> in politics, a man of great ability and good nature, but somewhat coarse and overbearing in character and 
manner; <persName>Draper</persName>, the <roleName>member</roleName> for Toronto, a clever active-minded man, and a fluent speaker; <persName>M'Nab</persName>, the member for 
<placeName>Wentworth</placeName>, also an able and influential man of large property; and <persName>Mr. Prince</persName>, member for <placeName>Sandwich</placeName>, a gentleman 
      educated at the <trait type="ethnicity"><label>English bar</label></trait>, and of very superior attainments, <roleName>liberal</roleName>, though not <roleName>revolutionary</roleName>, in principle. On 
the opposition side, the cleverest man and most eloquent speaker is <persName>Dr. Rolph</persName>.</p>
      <p>The <roleName>members</roleName> are paid for their attendance 
during the session at the rate of ten shillings a-day.</p> 
         <p>This slight sketch will give you some general idea of the 
political constitution and the state of parties in <placeName>Upper Canada</placeName>.</p> 
         <p>The prorogation took place <date when="1837-03-04">yesterday</date> at three o'clock; 
when we arrived in front of the government offices the scene was very striking. The snow-expanse was all around, 
and between the shore of the frozen bay and the line of building, the space was filled by sleighs of all shapes and 
sizes, the horses curveting and kicking up the snow, and a crowd of some hundred people in all manner of strange
defences against the piercing frost, intermingled with
<seg type="footnote">Now <roleName>Attorney-general.</roleName></seg>
<seg type="footnote"> Now <roleName>Solicitor-general.</roleName></seg>
<seg type="footnote"> Afterwards <roleName>Speaker of the House of Assembly.</roleName></seg>
            <pb n="112"/><seg type="pagenumber">110</seg>military costumes, and a few <trait type="race"><label>Indians</label></trait> lounging by in their blanket-coats and war-plumes.</p> 
         <p>The hall of the legislative council is a subject of great pride to the <trait type="ethnicity"><label>Canadians</label></trait>. It is certainly a spacious and lofty room, with a splendid 
throne and the usual superfluity of gilding and varnish; yet the interior decorations, (the admiration of the 
people here,) are in the vilest possible taste—which critical observation I make in no offensive spirit; any 
thing which is <hi rend="italics">attempted</hi> here, beyond the putting together of a log-house, is praiseworthy. We must have time—time! 
<q>"E coll' Tempo, tutto!"</q> On the right of the throne sat <persName>Chief Justice Robinson</persName>; he has a fine head and acute 
features, and the most pleasing, insinuating voice I ever heard. The <roleName>judges</roleName> and <roleName>law officers</roleName> of <roleName>the crown</roleName> sat at 
a table in front, and the other <roleName>members of the legislative council</roleName> were ranged on each side. My proper place was on 
the right, among the <roleName>wives</roleName> of the <roleName>officials</roleName>, the <roleName>aristocracy</roleName> of <placeName>Toronto</placeName>. The toilettes around me were gay and pretty, 
            in the fashion of two or three years ago, and all the <roleName>ladies</roleName> showed a disposition to be polite and amiable; but I
was too much a stranger to join in the conversation, and there were none near me to give me any necessary expiation,
or to point out any remarkable or distinguished persons, if there were such. Among the <roleName>spectators</roleName> opposite I remarked
a man with a very extraordinary head and countenance, and I was told that he was a <roleName>disciple</roleName> of <persName>Edward Irving</persName>, and a
preacher of the "Unknown Tongues," and that several persons
<pb n="113"/><seg type="pagenumber">111</seg>in <placeName>Toronto</placeName>, even <persName>members of the council</persName>, were <roleName>converts</roleName> to these wild doctrines.</p> 
            <p>The <roleName>governor</roleName>, as he alighted, was 
enthusiastically cheered by the populace—a circumstance rather unusual of late, and which caused a good deal of 
excitement and exultation around me. In a moment afterwards he entered and took his seat on the throne.</p> 
         <p>As an <roleName>official representative</roleName>, <persName>Sir Francis</persName> has not the advantage of the height, fine person, and military bearing of <persName>Sir John Colborne</persName>. 
He is a little man, with a neat, active figure, a small but intelligent head, grave and rather acute features; his 
bright blue eye is shrewd and quick, with an expression of mingled humor and benevolence, and his whole deportment 
in the highest degree unaffected and pleasing.</p> 
         <p>The <roleName>members of the <orgName>house of assembly</orgName></roleName> being summoned, appeared below 
the bar, and the <roleName>governor</roleName> read his speech over with very distinct utterance and much quiet self-possession. He 
recapitulated the most important enactments of the session, thanked the <roleName>gentlemen of the <orgName>house of assembly</orgName></roleName> for the 
promptitude with which they had relieved the <roleName>king</roleName>'s government from the embarrassment caused by the supplies having 
been withheld by the late <orgName>house of assembly</orgName>, and ended by congratulating both Houses on the harmony, confidence, and 
tranquillity which prevailed generally throughout the province.</p> 
         <p>The titles of the various bills passed during the 
session were then read; they amounted to one
<pb n="114"/><seg type="pagenumber">112</seg>hundred and forty-seven; the reading occupied about an hour and a quarter. Among them were a few which especially fixed 
my attention.</p> 
         <p>For instance, there was an act for making the remedy in cases of seduction more effectual, and for the 
provision of <roleName type="family">children</roleName> born out of wedlock by the supposed fathers, &amp;c. This bill originated in the legislative 
council, and it is worthy of remark that they are enacting <hi rend="italics">here</hi>, a law, which in <placeName>England</placeName> has been lately repealed, 
and which <persName>Sir Francis Head</persName> himself has openly condemned. You remember the outcry which was raised against that 
provision of the new poor law act, which made women solely answerable for the consequences of their own misconduct—
misconduct, into which, in nine cases out of ten, they are betrayed by the conventional license granted to the 
other sex; but I, as a woman, with a heart full of most compassionate tenderness for the wretched and the erring 
among my sister women, do still aver that the first step towards our moral emancipation, is that law which shall 
leave us the sole responsible guardians of our own honor and chastity; it may seem at first view most pitiable 
that not only the ban of society, but also the legal liabilities, should fall on the least guilty; and hard indeed
will be the fate of many a poor, ignorant <roleName>delinquent</roleName>, for the next few years, unless those women who take a generous
and extended view of the whole question, be prepared to soften the horrors that will ensue by individual help and
acts of mercy; but let the tendency of such an enactment, such a public acknowledgment of the
<pb n="115"/><seg type="pagenumber">113</seg>moral and legal responsibility of women, be once understood, let it once be brought into action, and I am sure the 
result will be the general benefit and elevation of the whole sex; it brings the only remedy to this hateful 
mischief which can be brought; the rest remains with ourselves. The best boon we could ask of our <roleName>masters</roleName> and 
<roleName>legislators</roleName>, is to be left in all cases responsible for our own actions and our own debts.</p> 
            <p>Another act provided two additional <roleName>judges</roleName> of the Court of King's Bench, and other law improvements, by which the gaol deliveries were
rendered more frequent, and the long and demoralizing imprisonment, previous to trial and conviction, would be 
shortened. This sounds well. I should observe, that by all accounts the gaols in this province are in a very bad 
state, and require revision altogether.</p> 
         <p>Another act established a provincial court of equity, rendered necessary 
by the nature of the land tenures here, and to secure in the possession of their property, those whose titles, honestly 
acquired, were defective from mistake, ignorance, or accident; also to punish frauds and breaches of trust, beyond 
the reach of common law. I was rather surprised to find that this act gave to the presiding <roleName>Chancellor</roleName> even larger 
            powers than those of the <roleName>Lord Chancellor</roleName> at home. It signifies nothing now, when there is <hi rend="italics">nothing</hi> on which these 
            powers can be exercised; but it will signify much, <date when="1887">fifty</date> or a <date when="1937">hundred years hence</date>, as society becomes more <seg type="pagesignature">10*</seg>
<pb n="116"/><seg type="pagenumber">114</seg>complex and artificial, and the rights of property more intricate.</p> 
         <p>The <roleName>chancellor</roleName> will have power to repeal (or, 
            what comes to the same thing, institute proceedings to repeal) all letters patent <hi rend="italics">improvidenily</hi> granted: an 
indefinite and dangerous power in bad hands.</p> 
         <p>Another act was to amend the charter of the <placeName>University of Upper 
Canada</placeName>. The <orgName>house of assembly</orgName>, in addressing the <roleName>governor</roleName> at the opening of the session, had expressed their 
regret, that "no useful result had hitherto attended the beneficent intentions of his majesty in granting a 
charter to <placeName>King's College</placeName>, and their hope that the province would shortly possess the means within itself of 
            bestowing upon the young a <hi rend="italics">refined</hi> and <hi rend="italics">liberal</hi> education."</p> 
         <p>Next to the <orgName>clergy</orgName> reserves, there is no question
which has been debated so long and so vehemently, as this of an endowed university. Forty years ago, in <date>1797</date>, 
the establishment of such an institution was recommended in an address from the provincial legislature to 
the <trait type="ethnicity"><label>British government</label></trait>, but it was not till <date>1828</date> that the charter was sent over. On this occasion, the legislative
council thanked <roleName>his majesty</roleName>'s government humbly and gratefully for such a munificent proof of paternal regard. 
The <orgName>house of assembly</orgName>, on the contrary, made their gratitude conditional—"provided that the principles upon 
which the charter has been founded shall, upon inquiry, prove to be conducive to the advancement of true 
learning and piety, and
<pb n="117"/><seg type="pagenumber">115</seg>friendly to the civil and religious liberty of the people."</p> 
         <p>In what might consist "the civil and religious 
            liberty of the people" was not so easily agreed. The first charter, modelled after those of our <trait type="ethnicity"><label>English 
universities</label></trait>, was deemed too exclusive for a young country like this, and became a source of contention and
dissatisfaction. The bills to alter and amend the terms of the charter sent up by the <orgName>house of assembly</orgName>, were 
always thrown out by the legislative council, and thus matters remained until this session. The act just 
passed abolishes the necessity of any religious test or qualification whatever in those who enter as <roleName>scholars</roleName>,
and places the establishment under the partial control of the <roleName>judges</roleName> and <roleName>legislature</roleName>, instead of the 
exclusive direction of the <roleName><orgName>clergy</orgName></roleName>. The <roleName>presidency of the university</roleName> remains with <persName>Archdeacon Strahan</persName>, but
for the future the <roleName>president</roleName> shall not necessarily hold any ecclesiastical office. Two <roleName>members of the legislative 
council</roleName> have entered a formal protest against this Act; they objected that half of the lands which had 
been granted for the erection of free grammar schools throughout the different districts, amounting to 
two hundred and twenty-five thousand acres, had been given up to the endowment of the university, and 
that these free-schools not being yet erected, this was a misapplication of the school-lands; and that after
such two hundred and twenty-five thousand acres had been applied to the uses of the university, the residue 
of the school-lands would not suffice for the purpose of erecting
<pb n="118"/><seg type="pagenumber">116</seg>free-seminaries, being of a bad quality; nearly eighty thousand acres of the lands originally allotted 
for the maintenance of schools having been exchanged for other lands of a worse quality, and less eligibly 
situated: that the benefits of a good education, instead of being equally diffused through the province, 
were confined to one large and expensive establishment—too expensive for the population and wants of the 
country."</p> 
         <p>Notwithstanding these objections, and the others made by the <roleName>Tory</roleName> and high church party, the act 
has passed after vehement debates, and I presume that the erection of the new university will be commenced
forthwith.</p> 
         <p>Another act was for the establishment of agricultural societies, and the encouragement of 
agriculture in the several districts. There are already agricultural societies in one or two districts, 
and whenever a certain sum of money was subscribed by the people, for such a purpose, the government 
assisted them with a further sum of one hundred pounds and upwards.</p> 
         <p>Various bills were passed, voting sums 
of money for the mending of roads; the improvement of the harbors and light-houses on the lakes; the 
completion of the great <placeName>Welland Canal</placeName>, which unites <placeName>Lake Ontario</placeName> with <placeName>Lake Erie</placeName>; and the opening of a 
great northern and western railway to connect <placeName>Lake Huron</placeName> with <placeName>Lake Ontario</placeName>. All this is very well; but,
as <persName>H.</persName> said this morning, where is the money to come from? It has become difficult to raise loans; and 
individuals do not willingly speculate in this 
<pb n="119"/><seg type="pagenumber">117</seg>country. That all these things will be done at some time or other is certain—certain as that the sun holds his
course in heaven, but some changes must take place before speculation on a large scale becomes either secure

         <p>A very important act was one introducing an improved system into the land granting department;
but the law, as explained to me, remains defective; all the arrangements of our domestic policy are such 
as to render it difficult and inexpedient for <roleName>aliens</roleName> to buy or hold land in this province, and even to 
            <trait type="ethnicity"><label>British subjects</label></trait> the terms are not so favorable as in the <placeName>United States</placeName>. <persName>Mr. Prince</persName> brought in a bill this
session for encouraging <roleName>settlers</roleName> from all parts of the world, permitting <roleName>aliens</roleName> to acquire and hold lands on 
easier terms than at present, and to claim the rights of citizenship after a three years' residence.</p> 
<p>"Every one," said he, "knows well, though I am almost afraid to mention it in this place, that countless 
   numbers of <trait type="ethnicity"><label>German</label></trait>, <trait type="ethnicity"><label>Swiss</label></trait>, and even <trait type="ethnicity"><label>British emigrants</label></trait> passed, during the summer of <date>1836</date>, through <placeName>Canada</placeName> to 
the western parts of the <placeName>United States</placeName>, and that none could be prevailed on to stop and settle in this 
province, though the fertility of the lands, and all other natural advantages, are confessedly greater 
here, and the distance saved from five to seven hundred miles."*</p>

   <trait type="ethnicity"><label>foreigners</label></trait> hostile to the principles of the <trait type="ethnicity"><label>British constitution</label></trait>. None denied that it would introduce both 
   population and capital, and that "men, women, and money," being the three <hi rend="italics">wants</hi> of the country, it would 
tend to supply these wants. With regard to the danger to our constitution, from the admission of <roleName>aliens</roleName> 
educated in different principles, one member made some shrewd and pertinent observations, in a very 
homely style. " We profess," said he, "to desire emigration, yet we prohibit virtually nine-tenths 
of the world from setting their foot on our shores; and why? Because these <trait type="ethnicity"><label>foreigners</label></trait>, naturally <roleName>republicans</roleName>,
   would naturally overturn our institutions. Now all <trait type="ethnicity"><label>foreigners</label></trait> are not <roleName>republicans</roleName>; the <trait type="ethnicity"><label>Swiss</label></trait>, <trait type="ethnicity"><label>Prussians</label></trait> and 
      other <trait type="ethnicity"><label>Germans</label></trait>, who pass through our country in multi¬ tudes, and cannot be persuaded to set up their rest 
   here, are more friendly to our <trait type="ethnicity"><label>British institutions</label></trait> than to those of the <placeName>United States</placeName>; and if it were 
otherwise, it is a poor compliment to our government and institutions, to say that they suffer from 
comparison, and that they who have enjoyed any other will not endure existence under ours. We are told that 
the <trait type="ethnicity"><label>Americans</label></trait> offer every inducement to <roleName>foreigners</roleName> and <trait type="ethnicity"><label>British subjects</label></trait> to settle in their new states; and 
we do not find that the monarchical predilections of these <roleName>emigrants</roleName> lead them to disturb the government 
of their new country," &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
<pb n="121"/><p><seg type="pagenumber">11</seg></p><p>This bill passed the <orgName>house of assembly</orgName>, and was lost in the Legislative Council. The fate of <placeName>Texas</placeName> was adduced

         <p>The vital question of the <orgName>clergy</orgName> reserves remains as yet 
unsettled by law; the motion for establishing fifty-seven endowed rectories within the province, exercising 
all powers, and privileges, and jurisdiction, which by the ecclesiastical law belongs to the Church of 
<placeName>England</placeName>, gave rise to a most violent and abusive debate in the <orgName>house of assembly</orgName>, which ended in the motion

<p>I was in hopes that some Act would have passed this session for the erection of a provincial <roleName>lunatic</roleName>

Instances are known of <roleName>pauper lunatics</roleName> straying into the forests, and perishing there. The fate of those 
confined in the prisons is not better; the malady is prolonged and aggravated by the horrid species of 
confinement to which, in such places these wretched beings are <hi rend="italics">necessarily</hi> subjected. A benevolent <roleName>physician</roleName> 
of this place (<persName>Dr. Rees</persName>) has offered a block of land a few miles from <placeName>Toronto</placeName> for the site of an hospital or 
asylum for <roleName>lunatics</roleName>, but at present it seems the intention of the legislature to take the penitentiary at 
<placeName>Kingston</placeName> for a <roleName>lunatic</roleName> asylum, and erect another penitentiary on a different plan. In the mean time this 
   dreadful evil continues—<hi rend="italics">must</hi> continue for two or three years longer; and think what an amount of 
individual suffering may be crowded into this period! When I was at <placeName>Niagara</placeName> there was a <roleName>maniac</roleName> in the jail 
there, who had been chained up for four years. Here was misery of the most pitiable kind suffering all the

         <p>As light was the eldest-born principle of the universe, so love was the eldest-born passion of

the witty sayings on this favorite text; but they are wrong, and their text misinterpreted. <persName>Eve</persName>, when she 
looked in passionate delight on her own lovely face reflected in the stream, knew not it was her own, and

<p>Where the vivacity of the intellect and the strength of the passions, exceed the development of the moral

This is especially the case <seg type="pagesignature">vol. i. 11</seg>
<pb n="124"/><seg type="pagenumber">122</seg>with women; but as far as my own observation and experience go, I should say that many more women have their

with the pressure of ill fortune. <persName>Sir James Mackintosh</persName> says somewhere, <q>"That almost every woman is either

         <p>Before the languid heart gasp and flutter itself to death, like a bird in an exhausted receiver, let 
us see what can be done, for something must be done. This relentless winter seems to stiffen and contract 
every nerve, and the frost is of that fierceness and intensity, that it penetrates even to the marrow of one's 
bones. One of the <roleName>workmen</roleName> told me yeserday, that on taking hold of an iron bar it had taken the skin off 
his hand, as if he had grasped it
<pb n="125"/><seg type="pagenumber">123</seg>red hot: it is a favorite trick with the <roleName type="family">children</roleName> to persuade each other to touch with the tongue a piece of

         <p>Let but the spring come again, and I will take to myself wings and fly off to the west! But will spring <hi rend="italics">ever</hi> come? When I look out 
upon the bleak, shrouded, changeless scene, there is something so awfully silent, fixed, and immutable in its 
aspect, that it is enough to disturb one's faith in the everlasting revolutions of the seasons. Green leaves
and flowers, and streams that murmur as they flow, soft summer airs, to which we open the panting bosom—panting
with too much life—shades grateful for their coolness—can such things be, or do they exist only in poetry 
and Paradise?</p> 
         <p>If it were not for this journalizing, I should fall into a lethargy—as it is I could envy a 
marmot or a dormouse; and if it were not for my promise to you, I should even abandon this daily noting of 
daily nothings, of which I begin to be thoroughly ashamed. One day is only distinguishable from another by
the degrees of the thermometer. Nor can I, while imprisoned by this relentless climate, seek the companionship 
and sympathy which stand aloof—for no other reason that I can guess—but because I come among them branded
with notoriety. I wished to throw open my house in the evening, and break or thaw the social frost around me; 
but such

A world ever at hand. I must try all mechanical means

   <p>I brought from <placeName>Weimar</placeName> 
<persName>Dr. Ekermann</persName>'s book,* which, as yet, I have only glanced over in parts; by this time it must be well known all 
over the world of literature. When I left <placeName>Weimar</placeName> it was
      <seg type="footnote">Gesprache mit Geothe. (Conversations with Goethe.)</seg>
      not yet published. There, my attention was strongly directed to this book, not so much by the interest, as by 
the kind of interest it had excited around me. I remember one of Goethe's grand¬ sons, turning over the leaves 
as it lay on my table, and exclaiming with animation—" Es ist der Gross¬ papa, selbst ! da lebt er !— da spricht 
er !" (It is grand-papa himself! —here he lives—he speaks!") Another, habitually intimate with the domestic life
of Goethe, said, with emotion—" Es ist das Buch von Liebe und Wahrheit." (It is the book of love and truth.) 
" Whatever may be in that book," said a dear friend of mind, when she placed it in my hands, " I would pledge 
myself beforehand for its truth. The mind of Ekermann, at once unsullied and unruffled by all contact with the 
world, is so constituted, that he could not perceive or speak other than the truth, any more than a perfectly 
clear and smooth mirror eould reflect a false or a distorted image." Now all this was delightful ! The sort of 
praise öne does not often hear either of a book or a writer —and so, to read I do most seriously incline. I read 
the preface to-day, and part of the intro¬ duction. In the preface, Ekermann says, very beautifully, " When I 
think of the fulness, the richness of those communications, which for nine years formed my chief happiness, and 
now perceive how little of all I have been able to preserve in writing, I feel like a child who seeks to catch
in his open hands the plen¬ il*
teous showers of spring, and finds that the greatest part has escaped through his fingers." A little farther on 
he says—" I am far from be¬ lieving that I have here unveiled the whole inward being of Goethe, (der ganze innere 
Goethe.) One may liken this most wonderful spirit to a many- sided diamond, which in every direction reflected a 
different hue ; and as in his intercourse with different persons, in different positions, he would himself 
ap¬ pear different—I can only say modestly—" This is my Goethe !" This may be said with truth of every character, 
viewed through the mind of another; of every portrait of the same individual painted by a differenti artist. 
And not only where we have to deal with marked and distinguished characters, but in the common in¬ tercourse of 
life we should do well to take this dis¬ tinction into account ; and on this principle, I would never judge a 
character by hearsay, nor venture further, even in my own judgment, than to admit that such a person I like and 
such another I dp not like. In the last case the fault, the deficiency, the cause, whatever it may be, is as 
probably on my side as on theirs ; and though this may sound offen¬ sive and arbitrary, it is more just than 
saying such a one is worthless or disagreeable, for the first I can never know, and as for the latter, the most
disa¬ greeable people I ever met with had those who loved them, and thought them, no doubt with reason» very 
agreeable. Of a very great, and at the same time complex
mind, we should be careful not to trust entirely to any one portrait, even though from the life, and of undoubted 
truth. Johnson, as he appears in Bos- well, is, I think, the only perfectly individualized portrait I remember; 
and hence the various and offen inconsistent effect it produces. One moment he is an object of awe, the next of 
ridicule : we love, we venerate him on this page—on the next we despise, we abhor him. Here he gives out oracles
and lessons of wisdom surpassing those of the sages of old ; and there we see him grunting over his favorite 
dish, and " trundling" the meat down his throat like a Hottentot. But in the end, such is the influence of truth, 
when we can have the whole of it, that we dismiss Johnson like a friend, to whose disagreeable habits and 
peculiarities we had become accustomed, while his sterling virtues had won our respect and confidence. If 1 had
seen Johnson once, I should probably have no impression, but that made on my imagination by his fame and his 
austere wisdom, and should remain awe-struck ; at the second interview I might have disliked him. But Boswell has 
given me a friend, and I love the old fellow, though I cannot love his bull-dog man¬ ners, and worse than bull-dog
prejudices. Were it possible to have of Goethe as universal, many-sided, and faithful a picture, it would be 
something transcendent in interest ; but I do not think he had a Boswell near him, nor any one, I imagine, who 
would be inclined to buy immortality at the same price with that worthy ; at least, Eker¬ mann does not 
seem such a man.*
The account of himself in the introduction is the most charming little bit of autobiography I have ever met with ; 
it is written to account for his first introduction to, and subsequent intercourse with, Goëthe, and is only too 
short. The perfect simpli¬ city and modesty, yet good taste and even elegance of this little history, are quite 
captivating. The struggles of a poor German scholar, the secret aspi¬ rations, the feelings, the sorrows, the 
toils, the hard¬ ships, of a refined and gentle spirit, striving with obscurity and vulgar cares and poverty, 
are all briefly but graphically touched—a sketch only, yet full of life and truth. Ekermann, it seems, was the 
son of a poor cottager and pedlar, residing, when

not engaged in his ambulatory traffic, in a little vil¬ lage near Hamburg. Though steeped in poverty, they seem to 
have been above actual want, and not unhappy. For the first fourteen years of his life Ekermann was employed in 
taking care of their only cow, the chief support of the family ; gather¬ ing wood for firing in the winter ; and 
in summer occasionally assisting his father in carrying the package of small wares with which he travelled through 
the neighhoririg villages. " All this time," says Ekermann, " I was so far from being torment¬ ed by any secret 
ambition for higher things, or any intuitive longing after science or literature, that I did not even know tbat they 
existed." In this case, as in many others, accident, as we call it, developed the latent faculties of a mind of
no common order. A woodcut of a galloping horse—the excise stamp, on a paper of tobacco which his father brought 
from Hamburg—first excited his admiration, and then the wish to imitate what he admired. He attempted to copy the 
horse with a pen and ink ; succeeded, much to his own delight and the wonder of his sim¬ ple parents ; and then 
by dint of copying some poor engravings, (lent to him by a potter in the neighbor¬ hood, who used them to ornament 
his ware,) he be¬ came a tolerable draughtsman ; he was then noticed and encouraged by a gentleman, who asked him 
if he should like to become a painter. Now the only idea of a painter which had ever occurred to his father and 
mother was that of a house-painter ; and as they had seen house-painters at Hamburg sus¬ pended on dangerous 
scaffolds, when decorating the
exterior of the buildings there, his tender mother begged him not to think of a trade in which he ran the risk 
of breaking his neck ; and the offer was re¬ spectfully declined. In the family of the gentleman who noticed him, 
Ekermann picked up a little French, Latin, and music; and now the thirst for information was awakened in his mind ;
he studied with diligence, and, as a clerk in different offices, maintained him¬ self till the breaking out of 
the war of deliverance, in 1813. He then, like every man who could carry a firelock, enrolled himself in the 
army, and made the campaigns of 1813 and 1814. The corps in which he served was marched into Flanders, and there 
for thè first time he had the perception of what pictures are, of all that he had lost in refusing to become a 
painter, and could have wept, as he says, for very grief and self-reproach. He passed all his leisure in wandering 
through the churches, gazing on the works of the great Flemish masters. At once the resolution to become an artist 
took pos¬ session of his mind. When his regiment was dis¬ banded, he set to work and placed himself under the 
tuition of Ramberg, in Hanover. There is something very touching in this part of his history; he had himself 
nothing in the world—no means of subsist¬ ence ; but he had a friend in tolerable circum¬ stances at Hanover; he
made his solitary way through the snow on foot to that city, and took up his residence with this friend of his 
youth, who shared with him his home and slender income. Anxious, however, not to be a burthen longer than
was absolutely necessary, he sought employment, worked so hard as to tuj ure his health, and brought himself to the 
verge of the grave—in short, he was obliged to give up all hope of studying art as a pro¬ fession, and he took to 
literature : here he show¬ ed the same indefatigable temper, and, conscious of his imperfect education, he put 
himself to school; and that he might be enabled to pay for instruction, procured the situation of a clerk in a public 
office. At the age of twenty-six he became a scholar in the second class of the Gymnasium, among boys of fourteen
and fifteen. Here, he says, the most ad¬ vanced pupils in the school, far from turning him into ridicule, treated
him with every mark of res¬ pect, and even assisted him in his studies; but be¬ tween his clerk's office and his
schooling, there re¬ mained to him scarce one moment either for food or exercise ; he was eager to perfect himself 
in the classics, remained ignorant of the great laws by which he held his existence ; and we are not sur¬ prised 
to find that the result of these excessive efforts, was broken health, a constitution almost destroyed, and, in 
fact, permanently injured. In the midst of all this, Ekermann found time to fall deeply in love ; and the wish to 
obtain distinction and some settled means of subsistence assumed another, a more pleasing, and a more anxious form.
But ill-health and a desultory education were against him. He wrote a book of poems, which was pub¬ lished and met
with some success ; the profits ena¬ bled him to goto a university, where forsorne timehe seems to have entertained
the hope of procuring an
office or a professorship, which should enable him to marry. Thus year after year passed. In the year 1822, he 
wrote his " Beiträge zur Poesie," (poetical essays,) and sent the mss., with a modest letter, to Goethe; the 
result was, an invitation to Weimar, where he finally took up his residence. Some time afterwards he procured a 
permanent situation, and was enabled to marry the woman he loved ; shy by nature, and averse to society, ambitious
only of lite¬ rary distinction, having laid up his whole heart, and hopes, and life, in the quiet pleasures of 
bis modest home, and in the society of the wife whom he had obtained after a protracted engagement of ten years, 
Ekermann during the next three years might, per¬ haps, be pronounced a happy man. In the third year of his marriage
he lost his amiable wife, who died in giving birth to a son, and since that time he has become more shy and 
inaccessible than ever— shrinking nervously from the presence of strangers, and devoted to the poor little infant
which has cost him so dear. The daughter-in-law and the grand¬ sons of Goethe, who look up to him with a tender 
reverence, he seems to idolize, and has become in some sort the literary Mentor and aid of the young men, as
Goethe had been his long years ago. It is a family tie, every way sanctified, and not, I trust, to be severed 
in this world by aught that the world can give or take away. The period at which these conversations com¬ menced
was an interesting epoch in the personal existence of Goethe ; it was about the time of his visit to Marienbad,
iu 1823, and was marked by the
composition of one of his finest lyrical poems, the elegy in three parts, which he has entitled, " Tri¬ logie der
Leidenschaft." He is then seventy-four, but in appearance sixty ; his eye still beaming with a softened fire, a 
cheek yet fresh with health, a well-knit figure, an upright, graceful carriage, a manner which took all hearts
captive. The grand, the beautiful old man!—old, yet, alasi still young enough, it seems, in heart and frame, 
to feel once more, for the last time, the touch of passion ; not a mere old man's love, such as we usually see 
it—half disease, or half infatuation—-at best a weakness—the sickly flare of a dying lamp; but genuine passion
in all its effects and under its most profound and most painful, as well as its most poetical aspect. Ekermann
merely touches on this subject with all possible, all becoming delicacy ; but there seems no occasion for me to
suppress here the mention of some circumstances not generally known, but which can bring nor shame, nor pain,
nor regret to any human being. The object of this love was a young person he had met at Marienbad—one of the 
daughters of Madame de L ------ w. She has been described to me as fair and rather full-formed, intelligent, 
accom¬ plished, and altogether most attractive. He began by admiring and petting her as a child—then loved 
her—loved her against,his will, his better sense, one might'almost say, against his nature. There was a report 
in Germany that he had offered her marriage ; this is not true ; but it was feared he might do so. He returned

in Germany that he had offered her marriage ; this is not true ; but it was feared he might do so. He returned
from Marienbad changed in manner; vol. i. 12
he had lost that majestic calm, that cheerfulness? which inspired such respect as well as affection in those 
around him ; and for some weeks all were in anxiety for the event. But Goethe was a man of the world, and a man
of strong sense; he resolved to free himself from a thraldom of which he felt all the misery and perceived all
the ridicule. He struggled manfully, and conquered ; but after weeks of terrible suffering and a fit of illness,
during which he was seized with a kind of lethargy, a sus¬ pension of all memory, perception, feeling, from 
which he was with difficulty roused : but he conquer¬ ed ; and on his recovery betook himself to his usual remedy
for pain and grief— hard work. He found "a file for the serpent," and was soon deep in his new theory of colors
and his botanical researches. If there be any one in the world so vulgar-minded and so heartless, as to find in 
this story of a great poet's last love,, a subject for cruel and coarse plea¬ santry, I must say that I pity such
a being. In the elegy alluded to, we find no trace of the turbulence of youthful passion—no hopes, no wishes, no 
fears, no desires, no reproaches such as lovers are wont to sing or say. It is no flowery, perfumed wreath of 
flattery thrown at the feet of a mistress, but rather the funereal incense of a solemn and fated sacrifice. It 
breathes the profoundest, the saddest tenderness— as if in loving he took leave of love. There is nothing in these
lines unbecoming to his age, nor discreditable to her, but all is grand, and beautiful, and decorous, and grave, in
the feeling and expres¬ sion. Sometimes, when I read it and think upon its
GOETHE truth, tears fill my eyes even to overflowing, and my very heart bows down in compassionate reverence, as if
I should behold a majestic temple struck by the lightning of heaven and trembling through its whole massy structure.
In other moments of calmer reflection, I have considered the result with another kind of interest, as one of the most
extraordinary poetical and psychological phenomena in the history of human genius. The first part of this poem is 
addressed to the shade of Werther, and contains some of the most powerful and harmonious lines he ever wrote ; to 
the second part be has prefixed, as a motto, those beautiful lines in his own Tasso — Und wenn der Mensch in seiner
Qual verstummt Gab mir ein Gott zu sagem was ich leide'! Ekermann says, that when Goethe laid before him this singular 
poem, he found it distinguished above all the rest of his manuscripts, written with peculiar care in his own neatest 
hand-writing, on the best pa¬ per, and fastened with a silken knot into a red morocco cover. This little piece of 
fanciful, senti¬ mental dandyism, will bring to your recollection the anecdote of Rousseau binding his favorite 
letters in the Heloise with ribbon couleur de rose, and using lapis-lazuli powder to dry the writing. # 0 * *
March 11. Went on with Ekermann's book, and found some interesting things. Ekermann, after he had spent some weeks 
at Weimar, tells his friend that he was beginning to feel the favorable influence of a more social life, and in some
sort to emerge from the merely ideal and theoretical existence he had hitherto led,&amp;c. Goëthe encourages him, 
and says strikingly, " Hold fast to the present. Every position, (zustand,) every moment of life, is of unspeakable
value as the representative of a whole eternity." The following passage is at once very touching and very characteristic.
He seems to be a little melancholy, which was not often the case, " When I look back," said Goëthe, " on my early and
middle life, and now in my old age reflect how few of those remain who were young with me, life seems to me like a 
summer' residence in a watering-place. When we first arrive, we form friendships with those who have already spent 
some time there, and must be gone the next week. The loss is painful, but we connect ourselves with the second 
genera¬ tion of visitors, with whom we spend some time and become dearly intimate ; but these also depart, and we
are left alone with a third set, who arrive just as we are preparing for our departure, in whom we feel little or 
no interest. " The world has always regarded me as a pecu¬ liar favorite of fortune, nor will I complain of my 
existence taken as a whole : yet, in truth, it has been little else than weariness and labor; and I may
say, that in my five-and-seventy years I have not en¬ joyed four weeks of peace and comfort—it was the eternal rolling
of the stone. The claims upon my time and capabilities, from within and from without, were too many. My only happiness 
lay in my poe¬ tic talents; yet even in this how have I been, through outward things, disturbed, limited, and hindered ! 
Had I kept myself more apart from public business, and could I have lived moréin soli¬ tude, I had been happier as a man, 
and as a poet I had effected much more. Thus, after the publi¬ cation of my Götz and my Werther, a certain sen¬ sible 
friend said to me in warning, ' When a man has once done something to delight the world, the world will thenceforward 
take care that he shall not do it a second time.' A wide-spread name, a high position in society, are doubtless good 
things, but with all my reputation and my rank, I could not often do more nor better than give way to the opi¬ nions 
of others ; and this were in truth but a sorry jest, if I had not therewith so far the advantage, that I learned 
(erfahre) how others thought : aber sie nicht wie ich." How solemn sounds all this from the lips of a man, who in 
years, in fame, in wisdom, in prosperity, ex¬ ceeded so far his fellow-men ! Pointing out to Ekermann some beautiful 
antique gems, and comparing them with the manner in which the same subjects and ideas had been treated by modern artists, 
he makes the oft-repeated observa¬ tion, how far in these later times we fall short of the classical models ; even with 
the highest feeling for IS*
the pure inimitable grace, the unaffected' nature of these relics, even with a conception of how it was all produced,
we cannot repeat the results we admire. " Meyer," he added, " used often to say, ' If only it were not во difficult to 
think;' but the worst is, that all the thinking in the world will not help us to think —we must go direct to nature, 
so that beau¬ tiful ideas shall present themselves before us like God-sends, (freye kinder Gottes,) and call out to 
us, ' Here we are ľ "* Tiedge, in 1800, wrote a poem on the immortality of the soul, entitled " Urania," and Goethe 
alludes amusingly to the sensation it produced for a time ; the " Urania" lay on every table—" Urania" and immortality
were the subject of every conversation, and stupid, conceited women discussed round their tea-tables the sublimest 
speculations on a future life; all which seems to have excited his impatience and his derision. . How truly he says
somewhere, that the same things are constantly repeated in the world ; that there never was any thing, any fact, 
that had only once existed ! How well I recollect when the publication of " Satan," and the " Omni¬ presence of 
the Deity," and some other poems of the same stamp, were all the rage in England, and sent our evangelical ladies, 
some up into the clouds, within precincts where seraphs fear to tread, and some down—never mind where—it was 
Tiedge's " Urania" over again. Of course, I speak here
only of the presumption and frivolity, amounting to profaneness and audacity, or worse, which I have witnessed in 
some women whose heated imagina¬ tions outran their reason, as different from the staid, the sober humility of 
real piety, as the raving Pytho¬ ness of old was unlike the meek Mary, " who sat at Jesus' feet and heard his words."
Goethe says, in the same passage, " that he would not himself give up for aught in the world the belief in futurity ; 
and he thinks with Lorenzo de Medici, that he who lives not in the hope of a future life may be counted as already 
dead ; but he exclaims against treating with vulgar and audacious fami¬ liarity the divine, the incomprehensible 
truths, which prophets and apostles touched upon with awe ; and I think with him. Goëthe has (has ? —I think of 
him as being now /) I should say, that out of a collection of more than seventy portfolios of engravings and 
original draw¬ ings, it was his general custom to have one or two laid on the table after dinner, and to turn 
them over in presence of his guests and the ladies of his family, discoursing most eloquently on the different 
subjects, or pleased to appeal to the natural sense and taste of those around him. It was a divine lecture on 
art. There are in one of these portfolios some most exquisite etchings and drawings by Roos, the famous animal
painter, all representing sheep or goats in every possible attitude, wonderful for their truth. " When I look 
at them," says Goethe, speaking in the fulness of his admiration, " I feel a certain
strange uneasiness. The narrow, stupid, silly, dreamy, yawny nature of these creatures attracts me into a kind 
of beastly sympathy with them ; I look at them till I am half afraid of becoming a sbeep myself, and could almost
fancy that the artist had been one ; he had no vocation to paint the fiercer quadrupeds, he confined himself to
the rumi¬ nating animals, and in that he did well : his sympa¬ thy with the nature of these creatures was born 
with him—it was innate." What would Goëthe have thought of some of Edwin Landseer's pictures—his wild deer—his
dogs !—the Highland Nurse, for instance, where the colley is watching by the sleeping infant ? Did Roos, or 
Snyders, or Rubens himself, ever give us the morale of animal life in the fine spirit of Edwin Landseer ? 
After some other things, Goethe goes on to say, that he thinks a knowledge of the universe must be innate 
with some poets. (It seems to have been so with Shakspeare.) He says he wrote " Götz von Berlichingen" when 
he was a young inexperienced man of two-and-twenty. " Ten years later," he adds, " I stood astonished at the 
truth of my own delineation ; I had never beheld or experienced the like, therefore the knowledge of these 
multifarious aspects of human nature I must have possessed through a kind of anticipation." Yes ; the " kind 
of anticipation" through which Joanna Baillie conceived and wrote her noble tra¬ gedies. Where did she, whose 
life has been pure and " retired as noontide dew," find the dark, stern,
terrible elements, out of which she framed the de¬ lineations of character and passion in De Montfort, Ethwald, 
Basil, Constantine ?—where but in her own prophetic heart and genius ?—in that intuitive, almost unconscious 
revelation of the universal na¬ ture, which makes the poet, and not experience or knowledge. Joanna Baillie, 
whose most tender and refined, and womanly and christian spirit never, I believe, admitted an ungentle thought
of any liv¬ ing being, created De Montfort, and gave us the physiology of Hatred ; and might well, like Goëthe,
stand astonished at the truth of her own delineation. Farther on, Goëthe speaks of the perfection with which 
some of the German women write their own language, so as to excel in this particular some of their best authors.
The same holds good in France and England ; so that to understand the full force of Goethe's compliment to his
countrywomen, one must recollect that it is no sucb easy matter to write a fine and clear German style, where 
there are twenty dialects and a hundred different styles. Prince Metternich once observed to me, " What I 
admire in your language is, that you have one good style in speaking and writing ; and all well-bred and well-educated
persons in England speak and write nearly alike. Here, in Germany, we have as many different styles as individual 
writers, and the dif¬ ference is greater than a foreigner could easily imagine." Yet even this kind of individuality, 
in point of style, may possibly have a value and a charm, and this will be felt if ever the rules of a good style be
so fixed by criticism or fashion, that all Germany will write uniformly. What he says of himself and Tieck is very 
inte¬ resting ; he speaks of him with admiration and kind feeling, but adds, " that when the Schlegels set up Tieck 
as a sort of literary rival to himself, they placed him in a false position. I may say this openly," adds this 
great man, with a dignified and frank simplicity. " I did not make myself; and it were much the same thing as though
I should even myself with Shakspeare, who also did not make himself—a being far, far above me, to whom I look up 
with reverence and wonder." Driving home one day from Tiefurt, as the car¬ riage turned, they faced the sun just as
he was sink¬ ing in the west. Goethe ceased speaking, and re¬ mained for a few moments as if lost in thought; then 
rousing himself, he repeated from some old poet— " Untergehend sogar ist's immer dieselbige Sonne." He then continued, 
with a most cheerful and ani¬ mated expression—" When a man has lived seventy- five years, he must needs think sometimes 
upon death. This thought brings me perfect peace, for 1 have the fixed conviction that the spirit is immor¬ tal, and 
has a never-ceasing progression from eter¬ nity to eternity ; it is like the sun, which only *ems to set to our earthly
eyes, but which in reality never does set, and never ceases to shine." Farther on, Ekermann expresses his regret that
Goëthe should have sacrificed so much time as direc¬ tor of the theatre at Weimar, and considers that many works were
thus lost to the world. To which Goëthe replies—" Truly, it is possible I might have written many good things during
that time; yet When I reflect, I feel no regret. All my produc¬ tions, as well as endeavors, I have been accustomed
to regard as merely symbolical, (that is, as I under· stand it, leading to something beyond, and signifi¬ cant of 
something better, than themselves,) and, in point of fact, it was with me as with a potter, to whom it is quite indifferent
whether he makes pitchers or whether he makes platters of his clay." • « · m
March 13. Idle to-day, and although I read a good deal, I translated very little, and noted less. Yet the following 
passage struck me. The con¬ versation turned on the German poetesses, and Reh- bein, Goethe's physician, insisted that 
the poetical talent in women was " ein Art von geistigem Geschlechtstrieb." " Hear him !" exclaimed Goethe ; " hear the
physician, with his ' intellectual impulse of sex !' " Rehbein explained himself, by observing " that the women who had
distinguished themselves in literature, poetry especially, were almost universally women who had been disappointed in 
their best affections, and sought in this direction of the intel-
leet a sort of compensation. When women are married, and have children to take care of, they do not often think of 
writing poetry."* This is not very politely or delicately expressed ; but we must not therefore shrink from it, for
it in¬ volves some important considerations. It is most certain that among the women who have been dis¬ tinguished 
in literature, three-fourths have been either by nature, or fate, or the law of society, placed in a painful or a false
position ; it is also most cer¬ tain that in these days when society is becoming every day more artificial and more 
complex, and marriage, as the gentlemen assure us, more and more expensive, hazardous, and inexpedient, women must
find means to fill up the void of existence. Men, our natural protectors, our lawgivers, our mas¬ ters, throw us upon
our own resources ; the quali¬ ties which they pretend to admire in us—the over¬ flowing, the clinging affections of
a warm-heart— the household devotion—the submissive wish to please, that feels " every vanity in fondness lost," 
the tender shrinking sensitiveness which Adam thought so charming in his Eve—to cultivate these, to make them, by 
artificial means, the staple of the womanly character, is it not to cultivate a taste for sunshine and roses, in 
those we send to pass their lives in the arctic zone 1 We have gone away from nature, and we must, if we can, substitute
another nature. Art, literature and science, re¬ main to us. Religion, which formerly opened the doors of nunneries 
and convents to forlorn women, now mingling her beautiful and sooth¬ ing influence with resources which the prejudices
of the world have yet left open to us, teaches us another lesson, that only in utility, such as is left to us, only 
in the assiduous employment of such fa¬ culties as we are permitted to exercise, can we find health and peace, and 
compensation for the wasted or repressed impulses and energies more proper to our sex—more natural—perhaps more 
pleasing to God ; but trusting in his mercy, and using the means he has given, we must do the best we can for
ourselves and for our sisterhood. The cruel preju¬ dices which would have shut us out from nobler con¬ solation 
and occupations have ceased in great part, and will soon be remembered only as the iude, coarse barbarism of a by-gone
age. Let us then have no more caricatures of metbodistical, card-playing, and acrimonious old maids. Let us hear no 
more of scandal, parrots, cats, -and lap-dogs^—or worse 1 these never failing subjects of derision with the vul¬ gar
and the frivolous, but the source ïf a thousand compassionate and melancholy feelings in those who can reflect ! In 
the name of humanity and woman¬ hood, let us have no more of them ! Coleridge, who has said and written the most 
beautiful, the most tender, the most reverential things of women—who understands better than any man, any poet, what
I will call the metaphysics of love—Coleridge, as you will remember, has asserted that the perfection of a vol. I. 13
woman's character is to be characterless. " Every man," said he, " would like to have an Ophelia or a Desdamona for his
wife." No doubt; the sentiment is truly a masculine one ; and what was their fate ? What would now be the fate of such
unresisting and confiding angels ? Is this the age of Arcadia ? Do we live among Paladins and Sir Charles Gran- disons,
and are our weakness, and our innocence, and our ignorance, safeguards—or snares ? Do we indeed find our account in
being " Fine by defect, and beautifully weab % n No, no; women need in these times character beyond every thing else ; 
the qualities which will enable them to endure and to resist evil; the self- governed, the cultivated, active mind, to 
protect and to maintain ourselves. How many wretched women marry for a maintenance ! How many wretched women sell 
themselves to dishonor for bread ! and there is small difference, if any, in the infamy and the misery ! How many 
unmarried women live in heart-wearing dependence ; if poor, in solitary pe¬ nury, loveless, joyless, unendeared; 
if rich, in aim¬ less, pitiful trifling ! How many, strange to say, marry for the independence they dare not other¬ 
wise claim ! But the more paths opened to us, the less fear that we should go astray. Surely, it is dangerous, it is 
wicked, in these days, to follow the old saw, to bring up women to be " happy wives and mothers ;" that is to say, let 
all her accomplishments, her sentiments, her views of life, take one direction, as if for women there exist-
ed only one destiny—one hope, one blessing, one object, one passion in existence ; some people say it ought to be so, 
but we know that it is not so ; we know that hundreds, that thousands of women are not happy wives and mothers—are never 
either wives or mothers at all. The cultivation of the moral strength and the active energies of a woman's mind,
together with the intellectual faculties and tastes, will not make a woman a less good, less hap¬ py wife and mother,
and will enable her to find con¬ tent and independence when denied love and hap¬ piness. # * # #
March 14. Got on better to-day. Goethe speaks with great admiration of the poems, original and translated, of Talvi, 
(Madamoiselle Jacob, now Mrs. Robinson, and settled, I believe, in America.) There is a great deal about Lord Byron in 
scat¬ tered passages. Goethe seems to have understood him astonishingly well—I mean the man as well as the poet.* At 
this time Lord Byron was turning all heads in Germany, and Goethe, who was flattered by the veneration and admiration 
of Byron, felt and ac¬ knowledged his genius. " He was," says Ekermann, " quite inexhaustible when once he began to speak
©f Byron," and as a poet himself, sympathized in the transcendent poetical powers he displayed ; but as a philosopher and 
sage, Goethe lamented the abuse, the misdirection of the talents he appreciated. He reproaches him with the negative, the
gloomy tendency of his mind ; he contrasts it with the healthful cheerfulness of such a spirit as Shak¬ speare's. 
Speaking of his strange attempt to de¬ fend and revive the strict law of the drama with regard to the three unities,
he says pointedly, " Had he but known as well how to restrain himself within the fixed moral limits !" In another place
he speaks with contempt of the poets, imitators of Lord Byron, " who write as if they were all sick, and the whole bright
world a lazar house." He says, "It is a real misuse and abuse of poetry, which was given to us to console us in the struggle
of life, and make man more con¬ tent with the world he lives in, not less." How entirely I sympathize with Goethe, when he
breaks out in indignation against the negative and the satirical in poetry and art ! He says, " When I have called the bad— 
bad, how much is gained by that ? The man who would work aright must not deal in censure, must not trouble himself about 
what is bad, but show and do what is good ,·" and this is surely true. He says elsewhere, that when there was doubt and 
contradiction in his mind, he kept it within himself; he gave to the public only the assured result, (or what he considered
such,) when he had arrived at it. This firmness of tone, this lofty and cheerful view of the universe and huma-
nity, strike us particularly in many of Goethe's works. He says himself, that the origin of most of his lyrics was truth ; 
some real incident, some real sentiment ; and some of his fine moral poems—for instance, those which he has entitled " 
Gränzen der Menschheit" and " Das Göttliche," remind me of Wordsworth, in the pure healthful feeling, as well as the felicity
and beauty of the expression through which it has found a channel to our hearts. He says of Winckelmann, with untranslatable
felicity, " Man lernt nichts wenn man ihn lieset, aber man wird etwas." This next is amusing, and how frankly magnani¬ mous!
He says, " People talk of originality— what do they mean ? As soon as we are born the surrounding world begins to operate 
upon us, and so on to the end. And, after all, what can we truly call our own, but energy,power, will ? Could I point out 
all that I myself owe to my great forerunners and cotemporaries, truly there would remain but little over!" Goethe could 
afford to say this ! He speaks of Schiller so affectionately, and with such a fine, just discrimination of his powers ! "All
in Schiller was high and great—his deportment, his gait, the mould of his limbs, his least motion, was dignified and 
grand—only his eyes were soft." And, adds Goethe, " like his form was his talent. We lived together," he says, " in such 
close, such daily intimacy, so in one another, that of many thoughts which occur in the works of both, it would be a
question whether they originated with the one or the other." The two great men thus bound together during their lives, were, 
after Schiller's death, placed in a kind of rivalship ; and still the partisans of the dif¬ ferent literary factions dispute 
where no dispute ought to exist. Coleridge says that " Schiller is a thousand times more hearty than Goëthe, and that Goëthe
does not, nor ever will, command the com¬ mon mind of the people as Schiller does," I believe it to be true. The reason is, 
that Schiller has with him generally the women and the young men, i. e. those whose opinions and feelings are most loudly, 
most enthusiastically expressed. Goëthe, in allusion to this, says playfully, " Now have the public been disputing for these
twenty years which of the two is greatest, Schiller or myself! Let them go and be thankful that have two such fellows to 
dispute about 1" He speaks of the new school of critical histori¬ ans, who have endeavored to prove that all ancient history
is fable. " ТШ now," be says, " the world has believed in the heroism of a Lucretia, a Mutius Scævola, and has been warmed 
and inspired by the idea. Now comes some historical critic, and assures us that these personages never had a real existence ;
that it is all fiction and fable, invented by the grand imagination of the old Romans. What have we to do with such pitiful 
truth ! If the Romans were great enough to invent such things, let us at least be great enough to believe in them I"
Here I should think he was epeaking more play¬ fully and feelingly than seriously and critically ; and is it not charming ? 
He goes on—" I used to be delighted with a cer¬ tain fact in the history of the thirteenth century, where the Emperor 
Frederic II. being engaged against the Pope, all the north of Germany lay open to invaders. The Asiatic hordes advanced even
into Silesia, where the Duke of Leignitz defeated them ; they turned back to Moravia, there the Count Stern¬ berg beat them.
These gallant warriors have hitherto lived in my imagination as the saviours of the German nation. Now comes your historical
critic, and he tells me that these heroes sacrificed themselves very unnecessarily, for that of the Turkish army would 
doubtless have retired of itself—so is a grand patriotic deed lessened and maligned, and one is put horribly out of humor."
It is plain that Goëthe, like Johnson, did not like to have his faggot disturbed. He adds, farther on, that in poetry this 
kind of sceptical criticism is not so mischievous. " Profes¬ sor Wolf has destroyed Homer, but he could do nothing to the 
poem itself, for the Iliad is en¬ dued with the miraculous property of the heroes in the Valhalla, who, though hewed to
pieces in the morning fight, always sit down to dinner with whole limbs." But there is no end to this—I must stop ; yet 
this about Shakspeare is so beautiful I must have it down. " How inconceivably rich and great is Shak-
speare! There is no motive* in human existence which he has not represented and expressed, and with what ease and freedom !
One cannot speak of Shakspeare, it is all insufficient. I have in the Wil¬ helm Meister, groped about him, but it is mere 
tri¬ fling ; he is no play-writer, he never thought of a stage ; it was too narrow, too paltry a space for his mighty spirit :
yes, even the great visible universe itself was for him in space too narrow ! " Nay, he is too rich, too mighty. A productive
poet should read but one piece of his in the year, or he will wreck himself in the vain attempt to reach the unreachable. 
"I did well," he adds, that in wri¬ ting my Götz and my Egmont, I shook him off my shoulders. How many excellent German
poets have been destroyed through him and Calderón î for Shakspeare," he adds fancifully, " presents to us golden apples 
in cups of silver ; through the study of his works we get hold of the cups of silver, but alas, we put potatoes into them."
I close my book, and so good night ! Where is he now, he who disappeared and could not be lost 1 —sitting with his

March 15. This last paragraph, which I wrote last evening, sent me to bed with my head full of all manner of thoughts and
memories and fancies ; and not being in a studious mood this miserably cold night, I draw my writing-table close to the fire,
and bestow all my tediousness on you, and if it were twice as much, and you were twice as far off, I would bestow it on 
you with all my heart —would you not accept the bargain ? I have been much busied to-day with domestic matters, for we 
are preparing to change our resi¬ dence for a new house never yet inhabited, and now I am alone in my room. I feel tired,
and have fal¬ len into a very dismal and fantastic mood. Whence and what are we, " that things whose sense we see not, 
frey us with things that be not?" If I had the heart of that wondrous bird in the Per¬ sian tales, which being pressed 
upon a human heart, obliged that heart to utter truth through the lips, sleeping or waking, then I think I would inquire
how far in each bosom exists the belief in the super¬ natural ? In many minds which I know, and other¬ wise strong minds
, it certainly exists a hidden source of torment ; in others, not stronger, it exists a source of absolute pleasure and 
excitement. I have known people most wittily ridicule, or gravely discounte¬ nance, a belief in spectral appearances, and
all the time I could see in their faces that once in their lives at least they had been frightened at their own shadow. 
The conventional cowardice, the fear of ridicule, even the self-respect which prevents intel-
ligent persons from revealing the exact truth of what passes through their own minds on this point, deprives us of a
means to trace to its sources and develope an interesting branch of Psychology. Between vulgar credulity and exaggeration
on the one hand, and the absolute scepticism and materialism of some would-be philosophers on the other, lies a vast space 
of debateable ground, a sort of twilight region or limbo, through which I do not see my way distinctly. One of the most 
gifted and accomplished, as well as most rational and most practical characters I ever met with, once said to me seriously, " 
I thank God I do not believe in the impossibility of any thing." How far are ourperceptions confined to our outward senses ?
Can any one tell ?—for that our perceptions are not wholly confined to impressions taken in by the outward senses seems
the only one thing proved ; and are such sensible impressions the only real ones ? When any one asks me gaily the so
common and common-place question—common even in these our rational times—" Do you now really believe in ghosts ?" I
generally answer as gaily—" I really don't know !" In the common, vulgar meaning of the words, I certainly do not ; 
but in the reality of many things termed imaginary I certainly do. While I was staying at Weimar, in Goethe's house, a 
very pretty little soiree was arranged for me at Madame ď Alefeldt's ; there were no cards that evening ; and seated 
round a table we became ex¬ tremely talkative and confidential, and at last we took to relating ghost stories. It should
seem that
Germany is still like Ireland, the land of the super¬ natural, as well as the land of romance. There was something quite
delightful in the good faith and the perfect sérieux of some of the narrators, as well as some of the listeners—myself 
included. Baron Sternberg gave us a story of an appari¬ tion at his sister'« castle in Livonia; it was admira¬ ble, and
most admirably told, though, truly, it seem¬ ed the last of all apparitions that oné would have expected to haunt a 
castle in Livonia, for it was that of Voltaire. Then the grand Duke gave us the history of a cer¬ tain Princess of 
Rudolstadt, whose picture is at Kochberg, and who, in the estimation of her family, had the gift of prophecy, of 
seeing visions, and dreaming dreams; but such visions and such dreams—so wild, so poetical, and even so gro¬ tesque
—shadowing forth the former and future des¬ tinies of her family ! and, in truth, the whole story, and the description
of the old castle of Rudolstadt, and the old court, and the three old superannuated princesses, like gothic figures 
woven into tapestry— so stately and so stiff, and so ugly, and withal so tinged with the ideal and romantic, were 
given with so much loveliness of detail, and so much graphic spirit, that 1 was beyond measure amused and in¬ terested.
I thought I saw them before me, and methinks I see them now. In return for this tale, I gave from the best autho¬ rity
that of Crofton Croker, the history of the Irish banshee, and particularly of that identical banshee, whose
visitations as the hereditary attendant on my
own family 1 had painful reason to remember. My banshee pleased universally ; to most of the com¬ pany the idea was 
something new, and I have even hopes that it may have inspired Sternberg with a pendant to his poem on King O'Donohue.
The conversation turned naturally upon heredi¬ tary apparitions and spectral penances, the fruit of ancestral crimes, 
on which superstition Grillparzer has founded his fine lyric drama of " The Ahnfrau." The castle of the W ------family,
in the neighbor¬ hood of Weimar, was mentioned as subject to this species of ghostly visitation. Two individuals 
pre¬ sent, who had been on a visit to this castle, spoke of the phantom avec connaissance défait. The pre¬ sent 
Baroness W ------, who had been brought up among enlightened and intelligent people, declared herself perfectly 
incredulous, and after her marriage went to inhabit the castle of her husband, in all the assurance that common
sense and philosophy could give ; but—so went the tale—it happened that soon after the birth of her eldest child,
she awoke at midnight, and beheld an unearthly being bending tiver the cradle of her infant—more, as it seemed, 
in love and benediction than with any unholy pur¬ pose; however, from this time they said that she had not willingly
inhabited the castle of her hus¬ band's ancestors. In the family of the Baron------, whose castle is also in the
heighborhood of Weimar, there is a gold ring of marvellous power, given by some supernatural being to a former Baron,
with the as¬ surance that as long as it remained iu the castle,
good fortune would attend the family. Every expe¬ riment made of late by unbelieving barons to put this tradition
to the test has been followed by some eignal disaster, the last time by a destructive fire, which consumed nearly 
the whole castle. This sto¬ ry also was very well told. ■■ It should seem that in these little German states there
was always some ancestor, some prince with a kind of Blue-Beard renown, to serve as the hero for all the tales of
horror—the bug-a-boo to frighten the children. Duke Ernest Angust plays the roh du tyran in the history of Saxe Weimar.
He was not only a tyrant, but atheist, alchemist, magician, and heaven knows what besides. Now, there was a profligate
adventurer, named Caumartin, who had insinuated himself into the favor of the Duke, be¬ came his chamberlain, and 
assisted him in his magi¬ cal and chemical researches. It is a tradition, that one of the ancestors of this princely 
family had dis¬ covered the philosopher's stone, and had caused the receipt to be buried with him, denouncing a 
terri¬ ble malediction on whoever should violate, from avaricious motives, his last repose. Duke Ernest persuaded 
Caumartin to descend into the family vault, and pluck the mighty secret from the coffin of his ancestor. Caumartin 
undertook the task with gay audacity, and remained two hours in the vault. On re-ascending, he looked pale and much 
changed, and took solemn leave of his friends, as a man con¬ demned to death. They mocked at him of course ; but 
on the third day afterwards he was found dead on the floor of his room, his rapier in his hand, his VOL. L 14
clothes torn, and his features distorted, as if by a fearful struggle. This story so oft repeated in different 
ages and countries, and in every variety and form, appeared to me curious in a philosophical and historical 
point of view. Duke Ernest August lived at the time when a wild superstitious credulity, a belief in ma¬ gic 
and alchemy, rose up simultaneously with the most daring scepticism in religious matters, both becoming fashionable
in Germany, France, and England, at the same time. It was the reign of Cagliastro and his imitators and disciples.
Do you not recollect, in the Baron de Grimm's memoirs, the story of a French adventurer, who was received into the
first circles of Paris as a supernatural being ? He was said to possess the elixir of life, and the wandering Jew
was apparently a youth to him in point of longevity. In the house of the Maréchal de Mirepoix he once sat down to
the harpsichord, and played a piece of music of sublime and surpass¬ ing beauty. All inquired whether it was his 
own composition, or where it was to be found ? To which he replied, with a pensive air—" The last time I heard it
was when Alexander the Great entered Babylon !" Many more stories were told that night of various interest, but all 
tinged with something poetical and characteristic. At last the party separated. I re¬ turned home, and, while still
a little excited, we con¬ tinued to converse for some time on influence of fancy and its various illusions, and the 
superstitions of Various times and countries. The thing was al-
ways there, forming, as it seemed, a part of our hu¬ man nature, and only modified and changed in its manifestations,
sometimes by outward influences, sometimes by individual temperament; fashion, or in other words, sympathy and 
imitation, having pro¬ duced many ghosts, as well as many maniacs, and not a few suicides. At last we bade good 
night. I lighted my taper, fixed in a candlestick of rather antique form, the same which had been used when Goethe
was chris¬ tened, and which I always took in myhand with due reverence. In coming up to my bed-room I had to pass 
by the door of the apartment in which Goethe had breathed his last. It has been from that moment considered as a 
sanctuary ; the things remain un¬ touched and undisturbed, and the key is deposited with the librarian. In the 
first or ante-room there stands—at least when I was at Weimar there stood —a large house-clock, which had been 
presented to Goëthe on the celebration of his jubilee ; it is the same which stood in the room of his mother, and
struck the hour he was born : after passing through various hands, it was purchased by the Grand Duke of Baden, 
and sent as a gift to the poet on that me¬ morable occasion. This clock, like the rest of the furniture of that 
sacred apartment, remains untouch¬ ed, but on this very night, by some inexplicable ac¬ cident, just as I arrived
at the door, the clock within began to strike— one, two, three, four, and so on to twelve. At the first stroke 
I stopped, even my breath almost stopped, as I listened. I looked not to the left, where the door opened into that hallowed
chamber of death and immortality ; I looked not to the right, where the dark hollow of the staircase seemed to 
yawn—nor yet before me ; but, with my eyes fixed on the silver relic I held in my hand, I stood quite stilL The
emotion which bound up my powers in that moment was assuredly the farthest possibly from fear, or aught resembling
it—it was only a sound, but it was the same sound and hour which had ushered into the world one of the great¬ est
and most gifted spirits whom God, in his supreme goodness, had ever sent to enlighten the world, and to enlarge 
the bounds of human delight and im¬ provement ; it was the same sound and hour which sentit to mingle with the 
great soul of nature, tobo A voice in all her music, from the moan Of thunder to the song of night's sweet bird 
; To be a presence to be felt and known In darkness and in light. And so in the silence and the loneliness of 
the night, as those sounds fell deliberately one by one, they seemed to fill the whole air around me, to enter 
in at my ears and thrill down to my finger ends, and I saw the light tremble which I held before me. But sense 
and the power of motion returned. In the next moment I was in my room and seated in His chair, with a steady pulse
and a calm spirit, glad to breathe again " queen o'er myself,"—my reason¬ able self; yet would I not have missed
the strange, the overpowering, deliciously awful feelings of those well-remembered moments—no—not for the 
uni¬ verse ! Short and transient as they have been, they
henceforth belong to the tissue of my life : were I to live a century, I cannot forget them, nor would I dare
to give them expression—if indeed there are words which could express them.
March 16. I was idle to-day, and, instead of going on regu¬ larly with my book, I turned over the leaves, and
dwelt upon passages here and there, as people, when they are nice and are not hungry, capriciously pick out 
tit-bits. The attempt to note down all that I would wish to retain in my memory of this delightful book, I find
hopeless, quite. At first I fancied it something like Boswell : nothing can be more unlike. The difference 
between Dr. Johnson and Goethe is not greater than the difference between Ekermann and Boswell. Boswelľs book
is delicious, but the man's personal character is always in the way; we profit often by his indiscretion, but 
his indiscriminate tri¬ fling as often disgusts. Johnson, in his book, is the " great Colossus" bestriding this 
narrow world, with a Pharos in one hand, and a bundle of darts in the other; but in Ekermann's book Goethe is 
nothing less than the " Olympian Jupiter," seated at his table and dispensing nectar and ambrosia, while he 
plays child-like with his own lightnings.* Boswelľs
meddling coxcombry and servility sometimes place his great patron in no very dignified position ; and the
well-known similes of the· monkey on the bear's back, and the puppy in the lion's den, seem hardly too severe. 
Were I to find a simile for Ekermann, I should say he is like a thrush singing under the wing of a great eagle,
sometimes overshadowed by his mighty master, but not overdazzled, not over¬ awed by the " terrors of his beak 
and lightning of his eyes"—always himself—and, as himself, always amiable, always respectable: His simplicity, 
his uprightness, and his gentleness, his poetical and ar¬ tist-like feeling, are always delightful : one must 
love him for his own sake as well as Goethe's. Yet a translation of this book would hardly please in England ;
it deals in " notions more than in facts," and in speculations and ideas, more than in anecdotes and 
personalities. It is necessary to take a strong interest in German literature and society, and in the fine
arts generally, to care about a great deal of it; it is something like Coleridge's " Table Talk," which
certainly few Germans would like or understand, though the criticisms and opinions are full of interest for 
the English reader; but it is yet more dramatic and lively in manner. When I was first in possession of this
book, and referring with delight to some few sentences which eaught my attention, a friend of mine, who had 
known Goëthe well and long, wrote me, in her own
peculiar style, some very charming things of its character and intention ; the meaning, and as nearly as I 
can, the words, I must try to render into English. " Ekermann's book," said she, " is the purest altar that 
has yet been erected to the fame of Goethe. In times like these, when the feeling of reverence (Pietat) 
seems to be fast departing, when a young author of talent takes up the pen, as a sort of critical dissecting
knife, mangling and prying where once he trembled and adored ; when his first endeavor is to fling down that 
heaviest burthen upon the soul of an egotist—the burthen of admi¬ ration for the merits of another, is it 
not pleasant to meet with such a book as this ? And when every thing one reads is so artificial, so gemacht, 
so im¬ pertinent, is it not delightful to open a book where in every page we feel the pulse-throb of a warm,
true heart ? I do not know if I am right, but it seems to me that those who cannot admire, can have nothing
in themselves to be admired; then how worthy of admiration must that man be, who thus throws down his whole
heart and soul in admiration before the feet of another ! the simplicity of this entire abnegation of self
lends to it a certain dignity. There is nothing here but truth and love—for Goëthe loved Ekermann, and О !
how Ekermann loved Goëthe ! " I can have no critical judgment here, and ought not to have ; I can only bear
witness to the general truth of the whole—nothing can be truer. I cannot be, like you, struck and charmed 
by particular pas-
sages. I was too long a sort of Lady High Trea¬ surer to be dazzled or astonished now that the caskets are 
opened. I greet the gems as old ac¬ quaintance !"
After this encouraging testimony, I go on with my notes and my translating. It appears that Schiller had 
the notion of a theatre where pieces should be given occasionally for men only, and Goëthe seems to approve
of this : I do not. The two sexes are more than sufficiently se¬ parated by different duties and pursuits ;
what tends to separate them farther in their amusements cannot be good for either. A theatre for men only 
would soon become a bear-garden. At an evening party, some of his own songs, to which Ekermann had composed 
beautiful music, were sung for him—he was much pleased. When all was over, he observed to Ekermann, that
the songs out of the " Divan,"* seemed to have no longer any connexion with himself : " both what is Orien¬ tal
and what is impassioned in those songs," said he, " have passed away from me ; it is like the cast skin of a 
snake, which he leaves lying on his path ; but the little song ' Um Mitternacht't remains with me, a living 
part of my own life." After several pages on all manner of things, I
find this remark on Schiller : " Through all his works," said Goëthe, " we have the idea of freedom. And this
idea changed its form as the genius and character of Schiller were progressively developed. In his early age 
it was physical freedom, in his lat¬ ter life the ideal ;" and afterwards he says finely, " that is not freedom
where we acknowledge nothing above ourselves, but that is freedom, when we can reverence something greater 
than ourselves." He says of La Grange, " he was a good man, and even through that, he was truly great ; for
when a good human .being is gifted with talents, he will work for the moral benefit of the world, whe¬ ther 
he be artist, natural philosopher, poet, or what¬ ever he may be." This is like what Weber wrote to Mendolsohn.
Farther on he says, " All that is great and distin¬ guished must be in the minority. There have been ministers
who had both people and sovereign against them, and yet have accomplished their own great plans ; it is not to
be hoped that reason will ever be popular. Passion, feeling, may be popu¬ lar ; but reason will be the possession
of the few."
March 6. I have often thought and felt, that while in Eng¬ land we have political liberty, we have nothing like
the personal and individual freedom, the social liberty of the Germans, even under their worst go¬ vernments. 
The passage which follows has, there-
fore, struck me particularly. Goethe, in speaking with approbation of Guizot, quotes his remark, that " from the
old Germans we derive the idea of per¬ sonal freedom, which was especially characteristic of that people, and quite
unknown in the ancient republics." " Is not this true V' said Goethe. " Is he not perfectly right Ì and is not the
same idea prevalent among the Germans of our own time ? From this source sprung the Reformation, and not less the 
various complexion of our literature. The continual striving after originality in our poets, so that each thinks it
necessary to make or find a new path for himself, the isolation* and eccentric habits of our learned men, where each
will stand on his ground, and work his aim out of his individual mind, all come from the same cause. The French and
the English, on the contrary, hold more toge¬ ther, and the people all imitate one another. There is something 
uniform in their dress and behavior ; they are afraid to swerve from a given fashion, to make themselves peculiar
or ridiculous. But in Germany every man follows his humor, without troubling himself about others ; each man 
endea¬ vors to suffice to himself; for in each man, as Guizot has well observed, lives the idea of per¬ sonal and
individual freedom, from which proceeds much that is excellent, and also much that is absurd." This appears to 
me very true, and must, I think,
strike every one who has been in Germany, and felt the interest which this kind of individuality imparts to society ;
though certainly I have met with travellers who were not a little put out by it. Life, with them, having hitherto 
flowed on " comme une gouette d'huile sur une table de marbre," they know not how to understand the little
projections and angles they have to encounter. The women appear affect¬ ed, and the men quizzical, precisely
because the former are natural and the latter original, and all very unlike the ladies and gentlemen they have 
left behind, whose minds, like their bodies, are dressed in the same fashion. # * # * When in Germany, I was 
accustomed to hear Madame de Staël's " De l'Allemagne" mentioned, if mentioned at all, with something worse than
con¬ tempt, either as forgotten or out of date. Her trite information, her superficial criticisms, her French 
prejudices, her feminine rashness, met with no quar¬ ter; but think only, what changes of opinion, what revolutions
in criticism, have taken place witbin thirty years ! Sir James Mackintosh—rich in all the lore of his age, beyond
his age in most respects — writes in 1807, (only two or three years before Ma¬ dame de Staël produced her book,)
of German lite¬ rature and criticism, as a sort of terra incognita, as the navigators of the fifteenth century 
talked of a western continent, venturing, but with hesitation, to commend Goethe, and seeming to think his ideas on
art not quite despicable—" rather plausible and inge¬ nious." He mentions the antipathy in France and England against
German literature, and speaking of distinguished modern writers, who might be con¬ sidered as likely to survive
their own age, he says, " I comprehend even Goethe and Schiller within the pale ; and though I know that few, 
either in France or England, agree with me, I have recourse to the usual consolation of singularity, that my opinion
will be more prevalent when I am myself forgot¬ ten." Madame de Staël first made a breach through what Goëthe himself
called a " Chinese wall of pre¬ judices;" and we may pass through it surely with¬ out trampling upon her who had
courage to open the way for us. The Germans understand us better than we under¬ etand them. To have a far stronger 
stamp of na¬ tional character than most other people, yet better to comprehend and appreciate what lies in the 
national nature of other people, is one of the most interesting characteristics of the Germans. Their language 
lends itself with wondrous richness and flexibility to translation from every tongue, and their catholic taste 
embraces all literature, without insist¬ ing on any adaptation to their own canons of criti¬ cisms or bienséance.
All that Goëthe says of art and artists is admira¬ ble—worthy of him who was the greatest critic and connoisseur 
of his country and age; for instance, what he says of Claude Lorraine : " His pictures have the highest possible 
truth, and not a trace of
reality ; he knew the real world in its minutest de¬ tails, and used these details as a means to express the fairer
world within his own soul ; and that is the true ideal, where real means are so used that the ap¬ parent truth shall
produce an illusion as if it were reality." He calls architecture " eine erstarrte musik," an expression as 
untranslatable as it is exquisitely feli¬ citous. And many other passages I leave unnoted with regret. Yet one
thing I must not omit, for it has made me think much. Goethe appears to consider our Saviour, with the twelve apostles,
as presenting too much uniformity to be a good subject for sculpture. The remark may possibly refer to the famous
bronzes of Peter Vischer on the tomb of St. Sibald at Nuremburg. I was struck by the variety and discrimination 
ex¬ hibited in these figures ; yet, on recollection, the variety was in the drapery and attitude—in the ex¬ ternal
, not internal character. It were easy to dis¬ tinguish in sculpture two such opposite characters as St. John and 
St. Paul ; but how are we to dis¬ tinguish St. Andrew and St. Simon, except by an external attribute, as that of 
giving St. Peter the keys, and St. Bartholomew his own skin over his arm, as at Milan ? How make St. Thomas look 
in¬ credulous ? So that, on the whole, there must be something characterless in such a group. Goethe says, that 
he had selected from the scrip¬ tures a cyclus of twelve figures as suited to sculp- VOL. ι. 15
ture, and presenting all together the history of our religion. 1. Adam, as the first man and father of mankind —a
type of human grandeur and perfection. He should have a spade, as the first cultivator of the earth ; and to 
express his character of progenitor and parent, he should be accompanied by a child, looking up to him with a 
bold confiding glance—a kind of boyish Hercules, crushing a snake in his hand ; (perhaps with reference to 
the promise.) 2. Noah, the beginner of a new creation, as a vine-dresser, who, by the introduction of the grape,
relieved the cares and made glad the heart of man. 3. Moses, as the first lawgiver. 4. After him, Isaiah, as 
prince and prophet. 5. Daniel, as the harbinger of the Messiah. 6. Christ, as Saviour and Redeemer. 7. John. 8.
The Centurion of Capernaum, as represent¬ ing the believer, the Christian. 9. Next, the Marv Magdalene, as the
symbol of humanity, reconciled to God through repentance. These two figures, Faith and Repentance, repre* 
senting the spirit of Christianity. 10. Next, St. Paul, as promulgator of its doc¬ trine. 11. Then St. James, 
as the first missionary^ representing the diffusion of Christianity among strange lands. 12. Lastly, St. Peter, 
as keeper of the gate of salvation. He should have an inquiring, penetrating expression, as if demanding of 
those who presented
themselves, whether they were worthy to enter the kingdom of heaven. " What do you think of this my cyclus ?" 
added Goëthe ; " I think it would be richer in expression and contrast than the twelve apostles. The Moses and 
the Magdalene should be seated." He says that he composed the witch scene in the " Faust," in the Borghese 
Gardens at Rome. If ever I visit those gardens again, what a strange association will now mingle itself with 
those antique statues, and fountains, and classical temples ! There is a great deal about his new theory of 
colors, which I read with interest, but dare not meddle with, because I do not quite understand all. This theory,
it seems, is intended to supersede Newton's theory of light and colors : whether it will or not is another thing ;
but as the savans in France have taken it up, I suppose it will be looked into by our own philosophers; and, 
meantime, which¬ ever way the question may be decided hereafter, Goethe's own feeling on the subject will be 
referred to with interest, either as a curious instance of self- delusion, or a sublime anticipation of future 
glory. " On what I have done as a poet," said he, " I would not presume much—I do not pique myself on it"—(hear this!)
—"excellent poets have lived as my contemporaries—more excellent before me— and others will live after me ; 
but that, in my own age, I am the only one who, in the profound science of colors, has obtained a knowledge of
the truth — in that I do give myself some credit—in that only 1 have a consciousness of superiority over many.''
This is something like the grand, calm, self-exul¬ tation of Milton. Is it as well founded?— Methinks I should 
like to know. He speaks in various places of the unseen, im¬ perceptible influences of all outward things in
form¬ ing the genius and character. " Surely," he says, " the man who has passed all his life long beneath the
lofty serious oak, will be a very different man from him who has lived beneath the shade of the myrtle and the 
willow." He says, feelingly, " It is not good for man to be alone, and, above all, it is not good for man to work
alone; he requires sympathy, encouragement, ex¬ citement, to succeed in any thing good : in this way I may thank
Schiller for some of my best ballads ; and you may take the credit to yourself," he adds kindly to Ekermann, " 
if ever I finish the second part of Faust." There is a great deal all through the second vol¬ ume relating to 
the second part of the Faust, which occupied Goethe during the last years of his life, and which he finished at 
the age of eighty-two. On completing it he says, " Now I may consider the remainder of my existence as a free 
gift, and it is indifferent whether I do any thing more or not ;" as if he had considered his whole former life 
as held conditionally, binding him to execute certain objects to which he believed himself called. He survived 
the completion of the Faust only one year. The purport of the second part of Faust has puzzled many German and
English scholars, and in Germany there are already treatises and comme«-
taries on it, as on the Divina Commedia. I never read it, and, if I had, would not certainly venture an opinion "
where doctors disagree ;" but I recol¬ lect that Von Hammer once gave me, in his clear animated manner, a 
comprehensive analysis of this wonderful production-—that is, according to his own interpretation of it.
" I regard it," said he, " as be¬ ing from beginning to end a grand poetical piece of irony on the whole 
universe, which is turned, as it were, wrong side out. In this point of view I un¬ derstand it; in any other 
point of view it appears to me incomprehensible. It contains some of the most splendid passages he has written."
Every where Goëthe speaks of Sir Walter Scott with the utmost enthusiasm of admiration, as the greatest writer
of his time ; he speaks of him as be-» ing without his like, as without his equal. I remember Goethe's 
daughter-in-law saying to me playfully, " When my father got hold of one of Scott's romances, there was no speaking
to him till he had finished the third volume : he was worse than any girl at a boarding-school with her first
novel !" I have particular pleasure in noting this, because I have seen in several English papers and reviews a
passage from some book of travels in which Goëthe, on what authority I know not, is repre¬ sented as holding Sir
Walter Scott in the utmost contempt. This is altogether false ; yet the same passage I have lately seen translated
into American papers, and thence into the papers of Upper and Lower Canada, Thus over the whole reading world 15*
is the belief diffused, that one great genius could either be wretchedly mistaken or enviously unjust in estimating
another great genius—a belief as dis¬ honorable to genius and human nature, as it is consolatory to the common cry 
of curs, to ignorant mediocrity, "for folly loves the martyrdom of fame."' I held in my own hands—read with mine 
own eyes —a long letter addressed by Sir Walter to Goëthe, giving an account of his own family, his pursuits, 
&amp;c., as friend to friend, and expressive of the utmost reverence* as weU as gratitude for marks of 
kind-. ness and approbation received from Goëthe. " A lie," says the Chinese proverb, " has no feet, it
cannot stand;" but it has wings and can fly fast and far enough. I onjy wish that truth may be· able: to 
follow it, and undo the mischief thus done— through some unintentional mistake perhaps,—but not the 
less mischief and injustice.
The following beautiful and original interpreta¬ tion of Goethe's ballad of the " Erl-King" is not in 
Ekermann's book ; but never mind, I give it to you in the words in which it was given to me. " Goethe's ' 
Erl-König' is a moral allegory of deep meaning, though I am not sure he meant it as such, or intended all 
that it signifies. " There are beings in the world who see, who feel, with a finer sense than that granted 
to other mortale. They see the spiritual, the imaginative sorrow, or danger, or terror which threatens them ;
and those who see not with the same eyes, talk rea¬ son and philosophy to them. The poor frightened child
cries out for aid, for mercy ; and Papa Wis¬ dom—worldly wisdom—answers, " l Mein Sohn, es ist ein 
Nebelstrief 1' « Or, " ' Es scheinen die alten Weiden so grau 1' " It is only the vapor-wreath, or the gray 
willows waving, and tells him to be quiet ! At last the poor child of feeling ia found dead in the arms of 
Wig- dom, from causes which no one else perceived—or believed ! Is it not often so ?"
What Goëthe says of false and true tendencies of' mind, and the mistaking a tendency for a talent, de^ serves
attention ; it is a mistake we often fall into,. both with regard to ourselves and others. He says, smiling, 
" People think that a man must needs grow old, in order to be wise; the truth is, that as years increase upon us
, we have enough to do to be as good and as wise as we have been. * * In certain things a man is аз likely to be
in the right at twenty as at sixty." On this point there is much more, to which I sub¬ scribe heartily. On the 
subject of religion I find this beautiful com-. parison, but am not sure whether it be Ekermann's
or Goethe's. "A connoisseur standing before the picture of a great master will regard it as a whole. He knows
how to combine instantly the scattered parts into the general effect ; the universal, as well as the individual,
is to him animated. He has no preference for certain portions : he does not ask why this or that face is beautiful
or otherwise ; why this part is light, that dark ; only he requires that all shall be in the right place, and 
according to the just rules of art ; but place an ignorant person before such a picture, and you will see that the 
great de¬ sign of the whole will either be overlooked by him, or confuse him utterly. Some small portion will at¬ tract
him, another will offend him, and in the end he will dwell upon some trifling object which is fami¬ liar to him, 
and praise this helmet, or that feather, as being well executed." " We men, before the great picture of the destinies
of the universe, play the part of such dunces, such novices in art. Here we are attracted by a bright spot, a graceful
configuration ; there we are repelled by a deep shadow, a painful object ; the immense whole bewilders and 
perplexes us ; we seek in yain to penetrate the leading idea of that great Being, who designed the whole upon 
a plan which our limited human intellect cannot comprehend."
When Goëthe was more than eighty, he purchased for the first time, an easy chair. His indifference, and even 
contempt for the most ordinary comforts
and luxuries of this kind, were amusing. The furniture of his study and bed-room (still preserved as he left 
them) is of the most homely description. A common deal table, a wooden desk, and a high stool, the very sight
of which gave me a pain in my back, were the only conveniences. He used to say, that never being accustomed 
from his youth to lux¬ uries and fine furniture, they took his attention from his work. But his drawing-room 
was elegant—I remember two very large frames, in which he was accustomed to dispose a variety of original
drawings by the old masters, perhaps eight or ten in each. When they had hung some time, he changed them for 
another set. These were his luxuries : the set of drawings which he last selected, remain hanging in the room. 
The anecdote related by Ekermann of the Roman cobbler who used an antique head of one of the Cæsars as a block 
to hammer his leather on, reminds me that the head of the Ilioneus was put to a similar use by a cobbler at 
Prague. The most extraordinary thing in this book is what Goethe calls " Das Dämonische." I have (I believe)
a kind of glimmering of what he means : whatever exercises a power, a fascination over the mind, whatever in 
intellect or nature is inexplicable, whatever seems to have a spiritual existence apart from all understood or 
received laws, acknowledged as irresistible, yet mocking all reason to explain it— a kind of intellectual 
electricity or magnetism—in short, whatever is unaccountable—he classes under the general head of 
" Das Dämonische ;" a very
convenient way, and truly a very poetical way, of getting rid of what one does not comprehend. It is, he 
says, as if " the curtain was drawn away from the background of existence." In things, he in¬ stances as examples
of this Dämonische, music in itself and in its eflect on the mind ; poetry of the highest order ; and iu
characters he instances Shak¬ speare, Napoleon, Byron, the late Grand Duke, (his friend, Karl August,) and others.
But it is danger¬ ous almost to go on playing thus with his and one's own deepest, wildest thoughts—and I cannot
follow them. There are passages scattered up and down this book, which clearly prove that Goethe never 
consi¬ dered himself ag one called upon to take a part in the revolutions and political struggles of his time ;
but because he stood calmly on the " shore of peace with unwet eye," and let the giddy torrent whirl past him, 
shall we infer that he took no heed of its course ? Can we think that this great and gifted being, whose ample 
ken embraced a universe, had neither sympathies in the grandest interests, nor hopes in the brightest destinies,
of humanity? It were a profanation to think thus ; "Although his heart (so near allied to earth) Cannot but pity 
the perplexed state Of troublous and distressed mortality, That thus make way unto the ugly berth Of their own

<pb n="183"/><seg type="pagenumber">179</seg>(Even while these lines were printing, Thomas Cariyle has observed, with equal truth and elo¬ quence, " That to 
ask of such a mind as Goethe's, that he should mix himself up with the political tur¬ moils of the day, was as 
if we should call down the moon from the firmament of heaven, and convert her intoa street torch.") Great and 
worthy of all gratitude and fame were those men, who have devoted their best faculties, poured out their best blood,
for the cause of freedom, for the land they called their own, the principles they espoused ; but greater far and 
more worthy of gra¬ titude, and of purer and more enduring fame, the very few, who lived not fór an age, a
country, but for all ages—for all mankind ; who did not live to preach up this or that theory, to sustain this
or that sect or party, to insist on this or that truth, but wb 0 lived to work out the intellectual and spiritual 
good, and promote the progress of the whole human race —to kindle within the individual mind the light which is 
true freedom, or leads to it. Such was the example left by Jesus Christ—such a man was Shakspeare—such a man 
was Goëthe.</p>

         <p>I have before me the list of <roleName>criminals</roleName> tried at the spring assizes here, and the <roleName>mayor</roleName>'s charge to 
the <roleName>jury</roleName>.</p>

<p>Assaults, seven.</p> 
<p>Keeping disorderly houses, six.</p> 
<p>The <roleName>mayor</roleName>, in his charge to the <roleName>jury</roleName>, complains of the increase 
of crime, and of poverty, wretchedness, and disease, (the natural causes of crime,) within the bounds of the
city, and particularly of the increase of <roleName>street beggars</roleName> and <roleName>juvenile depredators</roleName>, and he recommends the 
erection of a house of industry on a large scale.</p> 
         <p>Before we can estimate the increase in the number of 
<roleName>criminals</roleName> as the increase of crime, we must look to the increase of the population, which is enormous. The
whole population of <placeName>Upper Canada</placeName> has doubled in about nine years, the general average increase per annum 
being 18,712;* that of <placeName>Toronto</placeName> has doubled within five years. The whole number of criminal convictions for 
the city of <placeName>Toronto</placeName> only, from the spring assizes of <date>1832</date> to the assizes of the present year, (<date>1837</date>,) is 
four hundred and twenty-four men and twenty-five women; of the former ten were for murder, and twenty-three for
manslaughter and other violent crimes; and among the women, two were for manslaughter, all the rest were for 
larcenies and petty crimes.</p> 
         <p>These are very imperfect data, and quite useless where we wish to come at results;

         <p>About a week ago we removed into a new house, and I have since been too much occupied to go on with my

and is not quite finished. It will be very pretty and pleasant, no doubt, when it is not so <hi rend="italics">very</hi> cold and

that to reach the house-door is a matter of some difficulty and even danger. Planks laid from one snow heap 
to another form the only access to the house-door. The site, though now so dreary, must be charming in 
summer, for we command, at one glance, the entrance to the bay, the <placeName>King's Pier</placeName>, the lighthouse, and beyond,

difficult to keep myself warm. Nothing in myself or around me feels or looks like <hi rend="italics">home</hi>. How much is comprised 
in that little word! May it but please God to preserve to me all that I love! But, О absence! how much is

<p>I amused myself this morning with that most charming book "The Doctor;"—it is not the second nor the third 
time of reading. How delicious it is wherever it opens!—how brimful of erudition and wit, and how rich in 
thought, and sentiment, and humor! but containing assumptions, and opinions, and prognostications, in which I 
would not believe;—no, not for the world!</p>
         <p><persName>Southey</persName>'s is a mind at which I must needs admire; he stands upon
a vast height, as upon a pinnacle of learning; he commands all around an immense, a boundless prospect over 
whatever human intellect and capacity has achieved or may achieve; but, from the peculiar construction of his mind
, he obstinately looks but one way—back to the past, to what has been done; if ever he looks to the future, he 
merely glances at it sideways.</p> 
         <p>If I might, like <persName>Solomon</persName>, ask a gift of God, I would profit by his mistake. I would
            not ask a <hi rend="italics">wise</hi> and an <hi rend="italics">understanding</hi> heart: for what did his wisdom and his understanding do for him? They brought 
him to the conclusion, that all under the sun was vanity and vexation of spirit, and that the increase of knowledge
was the increase of sorrow, and so the end was epicurism, despair, and idolatry.
            <pb n="188"/><seg type="pagenumber">184</seg><q>"О most lame and impotent conclusion!"</q> No!—I would ask, were it permitted, for a <hi rend="italics">simple</hi> heart, that should 
not deceive itself or others, but seek truth for its own sake, and, having found truth, find also goodness and
happiness, which <hi rend="italics">must</hi> follow to complete the moral harmonic chord.</p> 
         <p>We are so accustomed to the artificial 
atmosphere round us, that we lose sometimes the power of distinguishing the false from the true, till we 
call in our natural instincts to do for us what our perverted reason cannot. They say that the <persName>Queen of Sheba</persName>
once presented before <persName>Solomon</persName> two garlands of flowers, and desired him to pronounce which was the natural, which
the artificial wreath. The wisdom of this wisest of men did not enable him to do this by the appearance only, 
so exquisitely had art imitated nature, till on seeing a bee fluttering near, he called it to his aid. The little 
creature at once settled the question by alighting on the real flowers, and avoiding the false ones.</p> 
         <p>We have instincts as true as those of the bee to refuse the evil and to choose the good, if we did not smother them up
with nonsense and metaphysics.</p> <!-- Horizontal Line **** --> 
         <p>How true what <persName>Southey</persName> says! (the <roleName>Doctor</roleName> I mean—I beg his pardon,)—<q>"We 
make the greater part of the evil circumstances in which we are placed, and then we fit ourselves for those 
circumstances by a process of degradation, the effect of which most people see in the classes below them, though
they may not be conscious that it is operating in a different manner, but with equal force, upon themselves."</q></p>
<pb n="189"/><p><seg type="pagenumber">185</seg></p><p>The effect of those pre-ordained evils—if they are such—which we inherit with our mortal state; inevitable 
death—the separation from those we love—old age with its wants, its feebleness, its helplessness—those sufferings
which are in the course of nature, are quite sufficient in the infliction, or in the fear of them, to keep the 
spirit chastened, and the reflecting mind humble before God. But what I <hi rend="italics">do</hi> deprecate, is to hear people preaching
resignation to social, self-created evils; fitting, or trying to fit, their own natures by <q>"a process of 
degradation"</q> to circumstances which they ought to resist, and which they do <hi rend="italics">inwardly</hi> resist, keeping up a constant,
wearing, impotent strife between the life that is <hi rend="italics">within</hi> and the life that is <hi rend="italics">without</hi>. How constantly do I read this 
in the countenances of those I meet in the world!—They do not know themselves why there should be this perpetual 
uneasiness, this jarring and discord within; but it is the vain struggle of the soul, which God created in 
his own image, to fit its strong, immortal nature for the society which men have framed after their own devices.
A <hi rend="italics">vain</hi> struggle it is! succeeding only in appearance, never in reality,—so we walk about the world the masks of
ourselves, pitying each other. When we meet truth we are as much astonished as I used to be at the carnival, when,
in the midst of a crowd of fantastic, lifeless, painted faces, I met with some one who had plucked away his mask 
and stuck it in his hat, and looked out upon me with the real human smile.</p><p><seg type="pagesignature">16*</seg></p>

<p>The Aurora Borealis is of almost nightly occurrence, but this evening it has been more than usually resplendent;
radiating up from the north, and spreading to the east and west in form like a fan, the lower point of a pale white,
then yellow, amber, orange, successively, and the extremities of a glowing crimson, intense, yet most delicate, 
like the heart of an unblown rose. It shifted its form and hue at every moment, flashing and waving like a banner 
in the breeze; and through this portentous veil, transparent as light itself, the stars shone out with a calm and 
steady brightness; and I thought, as I looked upon them, of a character we both know, where, like those fair stars,
the intellectual powers shine serenely bright through a veil of passions, fancies, and caprices. It is most awfully 
beautiful! I have been standing at my window watching its evolutions, till it is no longer night, but morning.</p><!-- Horizontal Line -->

         <p>So, there is another month gone; and the snows are just beginning to disappear, and the flocks of 
snow-birds with them; and the ice is breaking up at the entrance of the bay, and one or two little vessels 
<pb n="191"/><seg type="pagenumber">187</seg>have ventured as far as the <placeName>King's Wharf</placeName>; and the wind blows strong to dry up the melting snow, and some 
time or other, perhaps, spring will come, and this long winter's imprisonment will be at an end. Yes; I have been 
spoiled during these last years—I have been existing only for, and by, the highest faculties of my being—have lived
through admiration, hope, and love, <q>"until aversion and contempt were things I only knew by name;"</q> and now another
time is come—how ill, how very ill I bear it!</p> 
         <p>This is the worst season in <placeName>Canada</placeName>. The roads are breaking up, and 
nearly impassable; lands are flooded, and in low situations there is much sickness, particularly ague. We have 
still sixteen square miles of ice within the bay.</p> 
         <p>The market at <placeName>Toronto</placeName> is not well supplied, and is at a great 
distance from us. The higher class of people are supplied with provisions from their own lands and farms, or by 
certain persons they know and employ. With a little management and forethought, we now get on very well; but at first
we had to suffer great inconvenience. Quantities of salted provisions are still imported into the country for 
the consumption of the <roleName>soldiers</roleName> and <roleName>distant settlers</roleName>, and at certain seasons—at present, for example—there is some
difficulty in procuring any thing else.</p>
         <p>Our table, however, is pretty well supplied. Beef is tolerable, but lean;
            mutton bad, scarce, and dearer than beef; pork excellent and delicate, being fattened principally on <trait type="race"><label>Indian corn</label></trait>. 
The fish is of many various kinds, and delicious. During the
            <pb n="192"/><seg type="pagenumber">188</seg>whole winter we had black-bass and white-fish, caught in holes in the ice, and brought down by the <trait type="race"><label>Indians</label></trait>. 
Venison, game, and wild fowl are always to be had; the quails, which are caught in immense numbers near <placeName>Toronto</placeName>, 
are most delicate eating; I lived on them when I could eat nothing else. What they call partridge here is a small
species of pheasant, also very good; and now we are promised snipes and woodcocks in abundance. The wild goose
is also excellent eating when well cooked, but the old proverb about Heaven sending meat, &amp;c. &amp;c. is 
verified here. Those who have farms near the city, or a country establishment of their own, raise poultry and 
vegetables for their own table. As yet I have seen no vegetables whatever but potatoes; even in the best seasons 
they are not readily to be procured in the market. Every year, however, as <placeName>Toronto</placeName> increases in population and
importance, will diminish these minor inconveniences.</p> 
         <p>The want of good <roleName>servants</roleName> is a more serious evil. I could amuse 
you with an account of the petty miseries we have been enduring from this cause, the strange characters who come 
to offer themselves, and the wages required. Almost all the <roleName>servants</roleName> are of the lower class of <trait type="ethnicity"><label>Irish emigrants</label></trait>, in 
general honest, warm-hearted, and willing; but never having seen any thing but want, dirt, and reckless misery at 
home, they are not the most eligible persons to trust with the cleanliness and comfort of one's household. Yet we 
make as many complaints, and express as much surprise at their deficiencies, as though it were possible it could
be otherwise. We give to our
<pb n="193"/><seg type="pagenumber">189</seg><roleName>man-servant</roleName> eight dollars a month, to the <roleName>cook</roleName> six dollars, and to the <roleName>housemaid</roleName> four; but these are lower wages 
than are usual for good and experienced <roleName>servants</roleName>, who might indeed command almost any wages here, where all 
labor is high priced.</p> 
         <p>A carriage of some kind is here one of the necessaries of life, but a light <trait type="ethnicity"><label>English built
carriage</label></trait> would be quite unfit for the country—absolutely useless. There is, however, an excellent <roleName>coachmaker</roleName> 
here, who has turned out some very pretty equipages—both sleigbs and barouches—of the build which is calculated
for the roads in the neighborhood.</p> 
         <p>There are other good shops in the town, and one, that of the <roleName>apothecary</roleName>, 
worthy of <placeName>Regent-street</placeName> in its appearance. The importations of china, glass, hardware, and clothing, arrive 
from <placeName>England</placeName> in the spring and autumn, the seasons for making our purchases. All these articles are much dearer 
than in <placeName>England</placeName>, and there is little choice as to taste or fashion. Two years ago we bought our books at the 
same shop where we bought our shoes, our spades, our sugar, and salt pork; now we have two good <roleName>booksellers</roleName>' 
shops, and at one of these a circulating library of two or three hundred volumes of common novels. As soon as there
is a demand for something better, there will be a supply of course; but, as I said before, we must have <hi rend="italics">time</hi>.
<persName>Archdeacon Strahan</persName> and <persName>Chief Justice Robinson</persName> have very pretty libraries, but in general it is about two years 
            before a new work of any importance finds its way here; the <trait type="ethnicity"><label>American reprints</label></trait> of the <trait type="ethnicity"><label>English reviews and magazines</label></trait>,
            and the <trait type="ethnicity"><label>Albion newspaper</label></trait>, seem to supply amply our literary wants.</p>
<pb n="194"/><p><seg type="pagenumber">190</seg></p><p>Apropos to newspapers—my table is covered with them. In the absence or scarcity of books, they are the principal
medium of knowledge and communication in <placeName>Upper Canada</placeName>. There is no stamp-act here—no duty on paper: and I have
   sometimes thought that the great number of <trait type="ethnicity"><label>local newspapers</label></trait> which do not circulate beyond their own little
town or district, must, from the vulgar, narrow tone of many of them, do mischief; but on the whole, perhaps,
they do more good. Paragraphs printed from <trait type="ethnicity"><label>English</label></trait> or <trait type="ethnicity"><label>American papers</label></trait>, on subjects of general interest, the
summary of political events, extracts from books or magazines, are copied from one paper into another, till they
have travelled round the country. It is true that a great deal of base, vulgar, inflammatory party feeling is 
also circulated by the same means; but, on the whole, I should not like to see the number or circulation of 
the district papers checked. There are about forty published in <placeName>Upper Canada</placeName>; of these, three are religious,
   viz. the "Christian Guardian," "The Wesleyan Advocate," and "The Church;" a paper in the <trait type="ethnicity"><label>German language</label></trait> 
   is published at <placeName>Berlin</placeName>, in the <placeName>Gore district</placeName>, for the use of the <trait type="ethnicity"><label>German settlers</label></trait>; "The Correspondent and
Advocate" is the leading <roleName>radical</roleName>, "The <placeName>Toronto</placeName> Patriot," the leading <roleName>Conservative</roleName> paper. The newspapers of
<placeName>Lower Canada</placeName> and the <placeName>United States</placeName> are circulated in great numbers; and as they pay postage, it is no 
inconsiderable item in the revenue of the post-office. In some of these provincial papers I have seen articles 
written with considerable talent; amongst other
   <pb n="195"/><seg type="pagenumber">191</seg>things, 1 have remarked a series of letters signed <persName>Evans</persName>, addressed to the <trait type="ethnicity"><label>Canadians</label></trait> on the subject of an education
fitted for an agricultural people, and written with infinite good sense and kindly feeling; these have been copied 
from one paper into another, and circulated widely; no doubt they will do good. Last year the number of newspapers 
circulated through the post-office, and paying postage, was 
   <list><item><trait type="ethnicity"><label>Provincial papers</label></trait> - 178,065</item> 
   <item><placeName>United States</placeName> and <trait type="ethnicity"><label>foreign papers</label></trait> . 149,502</item> </list>
Add 100,000 papers stamped or free, here are 427,567 papers circulated yearly among a population 
of 370,000, of whom, perhaps, one in fifty can read;—this is pretty well. The gross receipts of the post-office 
are 21.000<hi rend="italics">l</hi>. a year. It is rather affecting to see the long lists of unclaimed letters lying at the post-office,
   and read the advertisements in the <placeName>Canada</placeName> and <trait type="ethnicity"><label>American journals</label></trait> for <roleName type="family">husbands,</roleName> relatives, friends, lost or

         <p>There is a commercial news-room in the city of <placeName>Toronto</placeName>, and this is absolutely the only place of 
assembly or amusement, except the taverns and low drinking-houses. An attempt has been made to found a mechanics'
institute and a literary club; but as yet they create little interest, and are very ill supported.</p> 
         <p>If the sympathy for literature and science be small, that for music is less. Owing to the exertions of an intelligent
<roleName>musician</roleName> here, some voices have been so far drilled that the psalms and anthems at church are very tolerably 
performed; but this gentleman
<pb n="196"/><seg type="pagenumber">192</seg>receives so little general encouragement, that he is at this moment preparing to go over to the <placeName>United States</placeName>.
The <roleName>archdeacon</roleName> is collecting subscriptions to pay for an organ which is to cost a thousand pounds; if the 
money were expended in aid of a singing-school, it would do more good.</p> 
         <p>The interior of the <trait type="religion"><label>episcopal church</label></trait>
            here is rather elegant, with the exception of a huge window of painted glass which cost 500<hi rend="italics">l</hi>., and is in a 
            vile, <hi rend="italics">tawdry</hi> taste.</p> 
         <p>Besides the <trait type="religion"><label>episcopal church</label></trait>, the <trait type="religion"><label>Presbyterians</label></trait>, <trait type="religion"><label>Methodists</label></trait>, <trait type="religion"><label>Roman Catholics</label></trait>, and <trait type="religion"><label>Baptists</label></trait>
            have each a place of worship. There is also an <trait type="ethnicity"><label>African church</label></trait> for the <trait type="ethnicity"><label>negroes</label></trait>.</p> 
         <p>The hospital, a large brick is yet too small for the increasing size of the city. The public grammar-school, called the "<placeName>Upper
Canada College</placeName>," forms a cluster of ugly brick buildings; and although the system of education there appears
            narrow and defective, yet it is a <hi rend="italics">beginning</hi>, and certainly productive of good.</p> 
         <p>The <roleName>physician</roleName> I have

            on their arrival in <placeName>Canada</placeName>—a house, where, without depending on <hi rend="italics">charity</hi>, they may be boarded and lodged at

         <p>The <roleName>King of Prussia</roleName>, after seeing <persName>Othello</persName>, forbade <persName>Desdemona</persName> to be murdered for the future, and the 
catastrophe was altered accordingly—<q>"by his majesty's command."</q> This good-natured monarch, whose ideas of art are
quite singular, also insisted that in the opera of Undine, Huldibrand should not die as in the tale, but become a 
water-spirit, and " all end happily ;" but I would not advise you to laugh at this, as long as we endure the new 
catas¬ trophes tacked to Shakspeare. It was Hoffmann, so celebrated for his tales of diablerie, and in Germany not
less celebrated as a musician, who composed the opera of Undine. The music, as I have been assured, was delicious, 
and received at Berlin with rapturous approval. After the first few representations, the opera-bouse was burnt down
, and with it the score of the Undine
perished. Hoffmann had accidentally one partie in his desk, but in the excess of his rage and despair he threw that
also into the fire, and thus not a note of this charming opera survives. Only the other day I was reading Hoffmann's 
analysis and exposition of the Don Juan. It is cer¬ tainly one of the wildest, and yet one of the most beautiful, 
pieces of criticism I ever met with—the criticism of an inspired poet and musician. Me¬ thinks that in this opera 
the words and the music are as body and soul ; and certainly we must judge the character and signification of the 
whole by the music, not by the words. Hoffmann regards Don Juan as a kind of Faust, and insists that Donna Anna was 
in love with him ; and the music given to her expresses certainly a depth of passion and de¬ spair beyond the words,
and something different from them. The text speaks the conventional woman, and the music breathes the voice of nature 
revealing the struggle, the tempest within. When at New-York this winter, I was introduced to a fine old Italian, with 
long and flowing white hair, and a most venerable and marked physiogno¬ my ; it was Lorenzo da Porta, the man who had 
first introduced Mozart to the Emperor Joseph, and who wrote for him the text of the Don Juan, the Figaro, and the
Cosi fan Tutti : we have no such libretti now ! The German text of the Zauberflöte was by Schi- ehenada, a buffoon 
comedian and singer in the ser¬ vice of Joseph II. ; he was himself the original Papageuo. Some people think that he 
meant to dramatize in this opera the mysteries of Freema¬ sonry, and others are anxious to find in it some pro-

found allegorical meaning; whereas I doubt whether the text has any meaning at all, while to the delici¬ ous music we
may ally a thousand meanings, a thou¬ sand fairy-dreams of poetry. Schichenada was pa¬ tronized by Joseph, and much 
attached to him; after the emperor's death, he went mad, and spent the rest of his life sitting in an arm-chair, 
with a large sheet thrown all over him, refusing to speak to his family. When any one visited him, he would lift the
sheet from his head, and ask, with a fixed look, " Did you know Joseph ?" If the answer were " Yes," he would, perhaps, 
condescend to exchange a few words with his visitor—always on the same subject, his emperor and patron ; but if the 
answer were " No," he immediately drew his sheet about him like a shroud, hid his face, and sank again into his 
arm-chair and obstinate silence : and thus he died.
April 29. This day, after very cold weather during the whole week, the air became filled with a haze like smoke, 
the wind blew suddenly hot as from the mouth of a furnace, and for a few hours I suffered exceedingly from languid 
depression, and could scarcely breathe. It was worse than an Italian sirocco. I cannot learn the cause of this 
phenomenon : the wind blew from the lake.
May I. Exceedingly cold,—a severe frost—a keen, bois¬ terous wind, and a most turbulent lake. Too ill to 17*
do any thing but read. I amused myself with Fried- rich Riickert's poems,* which left on my imagina¬ tion an impression 
like that which the perfume of a boquet of hot-house flowers, or the sparkling of a casket of jewels, would leave on 
my senses. As an amatory lyric poet, he may be compared to Moore ; —there is the same sort of efflorescence of wit 
and fancy, the same felicity of expression, the same gem¬ like polish, and brilliance, and epigrammatic turn in his
exquisite little lyrics. 1 suppose there could not be a greater contrast than between his songs and those of Heine.
It is greater than the difference between Moore and Burns, and the same kind of difference. Lenau.t again, is altogether 
distinct ; and how charming he is ! Yet great as is his fame in Ger¬ many, I believe it has not reached England. He 
is the great pastoral poet of modern Germany—not pastoral in the old-fashioned style, for he trails no shepherd's 
crook, and pipes no song "to Amaryllis in the shade," nor does he deal in Fauns or Dryads, and such " cattle." He 
is the priest of Nature, her Druid, and the expounder of her divinest oracles. It is not the poet who describes or 
comments on na¬ ture ;—it is Nature, with her deep mysterious voice, commenting on the passions and sorrows of 
humani¬ ty. His style is very difficult, but very expressive
and felicitous : in one of those compound words to which the German language lends itself—like the Greek, Lenau will 
place a picture suddenly before the imagination, like a whole landscape revealed to sight by a single flash of
lightning. Some of his poems, in which he uses the commonest stuff of our daily existence as a material vehicle 
for the loftiest and deepest thought and sentiments, are much in the manner of Wordsworth. One of the most beautiful
of these is " Der Postillion." Lenau has lately written a dramatic poem on the subject of " Faust," the scope and 
intention of which I find it difficult to understand—more difficult than that of Goethe. For the present I have
thrown it aside in despair.
The genius of Franz Grillparzer has always seemed to me essentially lyric, rather than dramatic : in his admirable
tragedies the character, the senti¬ ment, are always more artistically evolved than the situation or action. The 
characters of Sappho and Medea, in his two finest dramas,* are splendid creations. We have not, I think, in the 
drama of the present day, any thing conceived with equal power, and at the same time carried out in every part, 
and set forth with
such glorious poetical coloring. Lord Byron's " Sardanapalus" would give perhaps a more just idea of the manner 
in which Grillparzer treats a dramatic subject, than any thing else in our literature to which I could compare
him. Sappho is the type of the woman of genius. She enters crowned with the Olympic laurel, surrounded by the shouts
of gratulating crowds, and shrinks within herself to find that they bring her incense, not happiness—applause, 
not sympathy—fame, not love. She would fain renew her youth, the golden dreams of her morning of life, before 
she had sound¬ ed the depths of grief and passion, before experience had thrown its shadow over her heart, in the
love of the youthful, inexperienced, joyous Phaon ; and it is well imagined too, that while we are filled with 
deepest admiration and compassion for Sappho, be¬ trayed and raging like a Pythoness, we yet have sympathy for the
boy Phaon, who leaves the love of his magnificent mistress—love rather bestowed than yielded—for that of the
fair, gentle slave Melitta. His first love is the woman to whom he does ho¬ mage; his second, the woman to whom
he gives protection. Nothing can be more natural ; it is the common course of things. Learned and unlearned agree
in admiring Grill- parzer's versification of Sappho's celebrated ode— " Golden-Thronende Aphrodite !" —It sounds
to my unlearned ears wonderfully grand and Greek, and musical and classical : and when Schroeder recites these 
lines in the theatre, you
might hear your own heart beat in the breathless silence around.* German critics consider the " Medea" less 
per¬ fect than the " Sappho" in point of style, and, consi¬ dered merely as a work of art, inferior. Of this
I cannot so well judge, but I shall never forget read¬ ing it for the first time—I think of it as an era in
my poetic reminiscences. It is the only conception of the character in which we understand the neces¬ sity for
Medea's murder of her children. In the other tragedies on the same subject, we must take it for granted; but 
Grillparzer conducts us to the appalling catastrophe through such a linked chain of motives and feelings,
that when it comes, it comes as something inevitable. Medea is the type of the woman of instinct and passion.
Contrasted with the elegant, subdued Greek females, she is a <trait type="race"><label>half savage</label></trait>, all devotion and obedience one moment,
a tameless tigress in the next; first subdued by the masculine valour, then revolted by the moral cowardice 
of Jason. Grill¬ parzer has wisely kept the virago and the sorceress, with whom we hardly sympathize, out of 
sight as much as possible ; while the human being, humanly acted upon and humanly acting and feeling, is for 
ever before us. There is a dreadful truth and na-
ture in the whole portrait, which is perfectly finished throughout. Placed beside the Medea of Euripides, it 
is the picturesque compared with the statuesque delineation. The subject of the " Medea" has a strange 
fasci¬ nation around it, like that of the terrible agonized beauty of the " Medusa," on which we must gaze
though it turn us to stone. It has been treated in every possible style, in I know not how many trage¬ dies
and operas, ancient and modern. I remember, at Vienna, a representation of a singular kind given by Madame 
Schroeder; it was a monologue in prose, with musical symphonies, composed by George Ben- da, about 1755. 
After every two or three spoken sentences came a strain of music, which the actress accompanied by expressive
pantomime. The prose text (by Gotter) appeared to me a string of adjura¬ tions, exclamations, and imprecations,
without any coloring of poetry ; and the music interrupted rather than aided the flow of the passion. Still 
it was a most striking exhibition of Schroeder's peculiar talent ; her fine classical attitudes were a study
for an artist, and there were bursts of pathos, and flashes of inconceivable majesty, which thrilled me. The
fierceness was better expressed than the tenderness of the woman, and the adjuration to Hecate recalled for a 
moment Mrs. Siddons's voice and look when she read the witch-scene in " Macbeth;" yet, take her altogether,
she was not so fine as Pasta in the same character. Schroeder's Lady Macbeth I re¬ member thinking insufferable.</p>

         <p>—A very pretty place, with a very pretty name. A kind invitation led me hither, to seek change of air, 
            change of scene, and every other change I most needed. The <trait type="ethnicity"><label>Britannia steam-boat</label></trait>, which plies daily between 
<placeName>Toronto</placeName> and <placeName>Hamilton</placeName>, brought us to the mouth of the <placeName>Credit River</placeName> in an hour and a half. By the orders of <persName>Mr.
M * * *</persName>, a spring cart or wagon, the usual vehicle of the country, was waiting by the inn, on the shore of 
the lake, to convey me through the woods to his house; and the <roleName>master</roleName> of the inn, a decent, respectable man,
            drove the wagon. He had left <placeName>England</placeName> a mere child, <date when="1807">thirty years ago</date>, with his <roleName type="family">father, mother, and seven
brothers and sisters,</roleName> and eighteen years ago had come to <placeName>Canada</placeName> from the <placeName>United States</placeName>, at the suggestion
of a relation, to settle <q>"in the bush,"</q> the common term for uncleared land; at that time they had nothing,
as he said, but <q>"health and hands."</q> The family, now reduced to five, are all doing well. He has himself a 
farm of two hundred and fifty acres, his own property; his
<pb n="209"/><seg type="pagenumber">205</seg>brother as much more; his sisters are well settled. "Any man," said he, "with health and a pair of hands, 
            could get on well in this country, if it were not for <hi rend="italics">the drink</hi>; <hi rend="italics">that</hi> ruins hundreds."</p> 
         <p>They are forming a harbor at the mouth of the river—widening and deepening the channel; but, owing to the want of means and 
money during the present perplexities, the works are not going on. There is a clean, tidy inn, and some 
log and frame houses; the situation is low, swampy, and I should suppose unhealthy; but they assured me, 
that though still subject to ague and fever in the spring, every year diminished this inconvenience, as the 
draining and clearing of the lands around was proceeding rapidly.</p> 
         <p>The <placeName>River Credit</placeName> is so called, because

            delivered to them on <hi rend="italics">credit</hi> the goods for which, the following year, they received the value, or rather
ten times the value, in skins. In a country where there is no law of <roleName>debtor</roleName> or <roleName>creditor</roleName>, no bonds, stamps,
bills, or <roleName>bailiffs</roleName>, no possibility of punishing, or even catching a refractory or fraudulent <roleName>debtor</roleName>,
but, on the contrary, every possibility of being tomahawked by said <roleName>debtor</roleName>, this might seem a hazardous 
arrangement; yet I have been assured by those long engaged in the trade, both in the <placeName>upper and lower

nearly extirpated; a wretched, degenerate remnant of the tribe still continued to skulk about their 
old haunts and the burial-place of their <roleName type="family">fathers,</roleName> which is a high mound on the west bank of the river,
and close upon the lake. These were collected by the <roleName><trait type="religion"><label>Methodist</label></trait> missionaries</roleName>, into a village or settlement, 
about two miles farther on, where an attempt has been made to civilize and convert them. The government 
have expended a large sum in aid of this charitable purpose, and about fifty log-huts have been 
constructed for the <trait type="race"><label>Indians</label></trait>, each hut being divided by a partition, and capable of lodging two or more 
            families. There is also a chapel and a school-house. <persName>Peter Jones</persName>, otherwise <persName>Kahkewaquonaby</persName>, a <trait type="race"><label>half-cast

            contributions for his people, and married a young enthusiastic <trait type="ethnicity"><label>English woman</label></trait> with a small property.
            She has recently quitted the village to return to <placeName>Eurape</placeName>. There is, besides, a regular <roleName><trait type="religion"><label>Methodist</label></trait> 
               preacher</roleName> established here, who cannot speak one word of the language of the <trait type="ethnicity"><label>natives</label></trait>, nor hold any 
communion with them, except through an <roleName>interpreter</roleName>. He complained of the mortality among the <roleName type="family">children,</roleName>
and the yearly diminution of numbers in the settlement. The greater number of those who remain are

<pb n="211"/><seg type="pagenumber">207</seg><roleName type="family">children</roleName> are really splendid creatures; but the general appearance of the place and people struck me as gloomy. 
            The <trait type="race"><label>Indians</label></trait>, whom I saw wandering and lounging about, and the <trait type="ethnicity"><label>squaws</label></trait> wrapped in dirty blankets, with their 
long black hair falling over their faces and eyes, filled me with compassion. When the tribe were first 
gathered together, they amounted to seven hundred men, women, and <roleName type="family">children;</roleName> there are now about two 
hundred and twenty. The <roleName>missionary</roleName> and his <roleName type="family">wife</roleName> looked dejected; he told me that the Conference never 
allowed them (the <roleName>missionaries</roleName>) to remain with any <orgName>congregation</orgName> long enough to know the people, or take
a personal interest in their welfare. In general the term of their residence in any settlement or district
was from two to three years, and they were then exchanged for another. Among the <roleName>inhabitants</roleName> a few have 
cultivated the portion of land allotted to them, and live in comparative comfort; three or four women 
(<trait type="ethnicity"><label>half cast</label></trait>) are favorably distinguished by the cleanliness of their houses, and general good conduct; 
            and some of the <roleName type="family">children</roleName> are remarkably intelligent, and can read both <trait type="ethnicity"><label>their own language</label></trait> and <trait type="ethnicity"><label>English</label></trait>; 
but these are exceptions, and dirt, indolence, and drunkenness, are but too general. Consumption is 
the prevalent disease, and carries off numbers* of these wretched people.</p> 
         <p>After passing the <trait type="race"><label>Indian 
village</label></trait>, we plunged again into the depth of the green forests, through a road or path which presented 
every now and then ruts and abysses of mud, into which we sank nearly up to the axletree, and I began 
to appreciate feelingly the fitness

labyrinth of foliage, and intermingled flowers of every dye, where life in myriad forms was creeping,
humming, rustling in the air or on the earth, on which the morning dew still glittered under the 
thick shades.</p> 
         <p>From these woods we emerged, after five or six miles of travelling, and arrived at 
<placeName>Springfield</placeName>, a little village we had passed through in the depth of winter—how different its appearance 
now!—and diverging from the road, a beautiful path along the high banks above the <placeName>river Credit</placeName>, brought
            us to <placeName>Erindale</placeName>, for so <persName>Mr. M***</persName>, in fond recollection of his <trait type="ethnicity"><label>native country</label></trait>, has named his romantic

and frank-heartedness, with more of courtesy and manner than I expected to find. My reception was most 
cordial, though the whole house was in unusual bustle, for it was the <date when="1837-06-04">4th of June</date>, parade day, when 
the <roleName>district militia</roleName> were to be turned out; and two of the young men of the family were buckling on swords
and accoutrements, and furbishing up helmets, while the sister was officiating with a sister's pride at
this military toilette, tying on sashes and arranging epaulettes; and certainly, when they appeared—one
in the pretty green costume of a <roleName>rifleman</roleName>, the other all covered with embroidery as a <roleName>captain of

ground above the river which ran gurgling and spaikling through the green ravine beneath, the <roleName>motley troops</roleName>,
about three or four hundred men, were marshalled—no, not marshalled, but scattered in a far more picturesque
fashion hither and thither: a few log houses and a saw-mill on the river-bank, and a little wooden church
crowning the opposite height, formed the chief features of the scene. The boundless forest spread all 
around us. A few men, well mounted, and dressed as <roleName>lancers</roleName>, in uniforms which were, however, any thing but
uniform, flourished backwards on the green sward, to the manifest peril of the spectators; themselves and 
their horses, equally wild, disorderly, spirited, undisciplined: but this was perfection compared with the
<roleName>infantry</roleName>. Here there was no uniformity attempted of dress, of appearance, of movement; a few had coats, 
othere jackets; agreater number had neither coats nor jackets, but appeared in their shirt sleeves, 
white or checked, or clean or dirty, in edifying variety! Some wore hats, others caps, others their own shaggy
heads of hair. Some had firelocks; some had old swords, suspended in belts, or stuck in their waistbands,
but the greater number shouldered sticks or umbrellas. <persName>Mrs. M***</persName> told us that on a former parade day she
had heard the word of command given thus—"Gentlemen with the umbrellas, take ground to the right! Gentlemen 
with the walking-sticks, take ground to the left!" Now they ran after each other, elbowed <seg type="pagesignature">18*</seg>
<pb n="214"/><seg type="pagenumber">210</seg>and kicked each other, straddled, stooped, chattered; and if the <roleName>commanding officer</roleName> turned his back for a

off his plumed helmet, jump over the counter, to serve one <roleName>customer</roleName> to a "pennyworth of tobacco," and another 
to a "yard of check." <persName>Willy</persName>, the younger brother, a fine young man, who had been our <roleName>cavalier</roleName> on the field, 
assisted; and half in jest, half in earnest, I gravely presented myself as the <roleName>purchaser</roleName> of something or other,
which <persName>Willy</persName> served out with a laughing gayety and unembarrassed simplicity quite delightful. We returned to 
sit down to a plain, plenteous, and excellent dinner; every thing on the table, the wine excepted, was the 
produce of their own farm. Our wine, water, and butter were iced, and every thing was the best of its kind.</p>
<p>The parade day ended in a drunken bout and a riot, in which, as I was afterwards informed, the <roleName>colonel</roleName> had 
been knocked down, and one or two serious and even fatal accidents had occurred; but it was all taken so

dark pine-forest; and near to the house there were several groups of lofty pines, the original giant-brood of
the soil; beyond these again lay the "clearing." The sky was without a cloud, and the heat intense. I found 
breakfast laid in the verandah: excellent tea and coffee, rich cream, delicious hot cakes, new-laid eggs—a

<pb n="216"/><seg type="pagenumber">212</seg>own life nor that of any of his family was safe. They never went out unarmed, and never went to rest at night
            without having barricadoed their house like a fortress. The health of his <roleName type="family">wife</roleName> began to fail under this anxiety,
and at length, after a severe struggle with old feelings and old habits, he came to the determination to
convert his <trait type="ethnicity"><label>Irish property</label></trait> into ready money and emigrate to <placeName>Canada</placeName>, with <roleName type="family">four fine sons</roleName> from seven to seventeen
years old, and <roleName type="family">one little daughter.</roleName> Thus you see that <placeName>Canada</placeName> has become an asylum, not only for those who 
cannot pay tithes, but for those who cannot get them.</p> 
         <p>Soon after his arrival, he purchased eight hundred acres
of land along the banks of the <placeName>Credit</placeName>. With the assistance of his <roleName type="family">sons</roleName> and a few <roleName>laborers</roleName>, he soon cleared a
space of ground for a house, in a situation of great natural beauty, but then a perfect wilderness; and with
no other aid designed and built it in very pretty taste. Being thus secure of lodging and shelter, they proceeded
in their toilsome work—toilsome, most laborious, he allowed it to be, but not unrewarded; and they have now
one hundred and fifty acres of land cleared and in cultivation; a noble barn, entirely constructed by his
<roleName type="family">sons,</roleName> measuring sixty feet long by forty in width; a <roleName>carpenter</roleName>'s shop, a turning-lathe, in the use of which the
old gentleman and one of his <roleName type="family">sons</roleName> are very ingenious and effective; a forge; extensive outhouses; a 
farm-yard well stocked; and a house comfortably furnished, much of the ornamental furniture being contrived,
carved, turned, by the <roleName type="family">father and his sons.</roleName> These young men, who had received in <placeName>Ireland</placeName> the rudiments
            <pb n="217"/><seg type="pagenumber">213</seg>of a classical education, had all a mechanical genius, and here, with all their energies awakened, and 
all their physical and mental powers in full occupation, they are a striking example of what may be done by
activity and perseverance; they are their own <roleName>architects</roleName>, <roleName>masons</roleName>, <roleName>smiths</roleName>, <roleName>carpenters</roleName>, <roleName>farmers</roleName>, <roleName>gardeners</roleName>; 
they are, moreover, bold and keen <roleName>hunters</roleName>, quick in resource, intelligent, cheerful, united by strong affection, 
and doating on their gentle sister, who has grown up among these four tall, manly brothers, like a beautiful
azalia under the towering and sheltering pines. Then I should add, that one of the young men knows something 
of surgery, can bleed or set a broken limb in case of necessity; while another knows as much of law as enables 
him to draw up an agreement, and settle the quarrels and arrange the little difficulties of their poorer 
<roleName>neighbors</roleName>, without having recourse to the "<roleName>attorney</roleName>."</p> 
         <p>The whole family appear to have a lively feeling 
for natural beauty, and a taste for natural history; they know the habits and the haunts of the wild animals
which people their forest domain; they have made collections of minerals and insects, and have <q>"traced each
herb and flower that sips the silvery dew."</q> Not only the stout <roleName>servant girl</roleName>, (whom I met running about with 
            a sucking-pig in her arms, looking for its mother.) and the <trait type="ethnicity"><label>little black boy</label></trait> <persName>Alick</persName>;—but the animals in 
the farm-yard, the old favorite mare, the fowls which come trooping round the benignant old gentleman, or 
are the peculiar pets of the ladies of the family,—the very dogs and cats appear to me, each and all, the 
most enviable of their species.</p>
         <pb n="218"/><p><seg type="pagenumber">214</seg></p><p>There is an atmosphere of benevolence and cheerfulness breathing round, which penetrates to my very heart. I
know not when I have felt so quietly—so entirely happy—so full of sympathy—so light-hearted—so inclined to 
shut out the world, and its cares and vanities, and <q>"fleet the time as they did i' the golden age."</q></p> 
         <p>In the evening it was very sultry, the sky was magnificently troubled, and the clouds came rolling down, mingling, as it seemed
to me, with the pine tops. We walked up and down the verandah, listening to the soft melancholy cry of the 
whip-poor-will, and watching the evolutions of some beautiful green snakes of a perfectly harmless species, which
were gliding after each other along the garden walks; by degrees a brooding silence and thick darkness fell around
us; then the storm burst forth in all its might, the lightning wrapped the whole horizon round in sheets of flame, 
the thunder rolled over the forest, and still we lingered—lingered till the fury and tumult of the elements had 
subsided, and the rain began to fall in torrents; we then went into the house and had some music. <persName>Charles</persName> and 
<persName>Willy</persName> had good voices, and much natural taste; and we sang duets and trios till supper-time. We again assembled 
round the cheerful table, where there was infinite laughing—the heart's laugh—and many a jest seasoned with true
            <trait type="ethnicity"><label>Irish gallantry and humor</label></trait>; and then the good old gentleman, after discussing his sober tumbler of whiskey-punch, 
sent us all with his blessing to our rest.</p>
<pb n="219"/><p><seg type="pagenumber">215</seg></p><p><persName>Mr. M.</persName> told me, that for the first seven or eight years they had all lived and worked together on his farm; but 
latterly he had reflected that though the proceeds of the farm afforded a subsistence, it did not furnish the
means of independence for his <roleName type="family">sons,</roleName> so as to enable them to marry and settle in the world. He has therefore 
established two of his <roleName type="family">sons</roleName> as <roleName>storekeepers</roleName>, the one in <placeName>Springfield</placeName>, the other at <placeName>Streetsville</placeName>, both within a
short distance of his own residence, and they have already, by their intelligence, activity, and popular manners, 
succeeded beyond his hopes.</p> 
         <p>I could perceive that in taking this step there had been certain prejudices and 
            feelings to be overcome, on his own part and that of his <roleName type="family">wife:</roleName> the family pride of the <trait type="ethnicity"><label>well-born Irish gentleman</label></trait>,
and the antipathy to any thing like trade, once cherished by a certain class in the <placeName>old country</placeName>—these were to 
            be conquered, before he could reconcile himself to the idea of his boys serving out groceries in a <trait type="ethnicity"><label>Canadian village</label></trait>;
            but they <hi rend="italics">were</hi> overcome. Some lingering of the "old <persName>Adam</persName>" made him think it necessary to excuse—to account for
this state of things. He did not know with what entire and approving sympathy I regarded, not the foolish 
national prejudices of my country, but the honest, generous spirit and good, sense through which he had conquered
them, and provided for the future independence of his <roleName type="family">children.</roleName></p> 
         <p>I inquired concerning the extent of his parish,
and the morals and condition of his <roleName>parishioners</roleName>.</p> 
         <p>He said that on two sides the district under his
<pb n="220"/><seg type="pagenumber">216</seg>charge might be considered as without bounds, for, in fact, there was no parish boundary line between him and 
the <placeName>North Pole</placeName>. He has frequently ridden from sixteen to thirty miles to officiate at a marriage or a funeral,
or baptize a child, or preach a sermon, wherever a small <orgName>congregation</orgName> could be collected together; but latterly 
his increasing age rendered such exertion difficult. His parish church is in <placeName>Springfield</placeName>. When he first took the
living, to which he was appointed on his arrival in the country, the salary—for here there are no tithes—was 
two hundred a year: some late measure, fathered by <persName>Mr. Hume</persName>, had reduced it to one hundred. He spoke of this 
without bitterness as regarded himself, observing that he was old, and had other means of subsistence; but he 
considered it as great injustice both to himself and to his successors—"For," said he, "it is clear that no
man could take charge of this extensive district without keeping a good horse and a boy to rub him down. Now, in this 
country, where wages are high, he could not keep a horse and a <roleName>servant</roleName>, and wear a whole coat, for less than one 
            hundred a year. No man, therefore, who <hi rend="italics">had</hi> not other resources, could live upon this sum; and no man who had 
other resources, and had received a fitting education, would be likely to come here, I say nothing of the toil,
the fatigue, the deep responsibility—these belong to his vocation, in which, though a man must labor, he need
not surely starve:—yet starve he must, unless he takes a farm or a store in addition to his
<pb n="221"/><seg type="pagenumber">217</seg>clerical duties. A <roleName>clergyman</roleName> in such circumstances could hardly command the respect of his <roleName>parishioners</roleName>: what do
            <hi rend="italics">you</hi> think, madam?</p> 
         <p>When the question was thus put, I could only think the same; it seems to me that there must 
            be something wrong in the whole of this <trait type="ethnicity"><label>Canadian church</label></trait> system, from beginning to end.</p> 
         <p>With regard to the morals of the population around him, he spoke of two things as especially lamentable, the prevalence of drunkenness, and
the early severing of parental and family ties; the first, partly owing to the low price of whiskey, the latter
to the high price of labor, which rendered it the interest of the young of both sexes to leave their home, and 
look out and provide for themselves as soon as possible. This fact, and its consequences, struck him the more 
painfully, from the contrast it exhibited to the strong family affections, and respect for parental authority,
which even in the midst of squalid, reckless misery and ruin, he had been accustomed to in poor <placeName>Ireland</placeName>. The
general morals of the women he considered infinitely superior to those of the men; and in the midst of the horrid
example and temptation, and one may add, provocation, round them, their habits were generally sober. He 
knew himself but two females abandoned to habits of intoxication, and in both instances the cause had been the 
same—an unhappy home and <roleName type="family">a brutal husband.</roleName></p>
         <p>He told me many other interesting circumstances and anecdotes, but 
            being of a personal nature, and <seg type="pagesignature">vol. I. 19</seg>
<pb n="222"/><seg type="pagenumber">218</seg>his permission not expressly given, I do not note them down here.</p> 
         <p>On the whole, I shall never forget the few 
days spent with this excellent family. We bade farewell, after many a cordial entreaty on their part, many 
a promise on mine, to visit them again. <persName>Charles M.</persName> drove me over to the <placeName>Credit</placeName>, where we met the steam-boat, 
and I returned to <placeName>Toronto</placeName> with my heart full of kindly feelings, my fancy full of delightful images, and my 
lap full of flowers, which <persName>Charles</persName> had gathered for me along the margin of the forest: flowers such as we 
transplant and nurture with care in our gardens and green-houses, most dazzling and lovely in color, strange
and new to me in their forms, and names, and uses; unluckily I am no <roleName>botanist</roleName>, so will not venture to 
particularize farther; but one plant struck me particularly, growing every where in thousands: the stalk 
was about two feet in height, and at the top were two large fan-like leaves, one being always larger than the 
other; from between the two sprung a single flower, in size and shape somewhat resembling a large wild rose, the 
petal white, just tinted with a pale plush. The flower is succeeded by an oval-shaped fruit, which is eaten, and 
makes an excellent preserve. They call it here the May-apple.</p>

         <p>We have already exchanged "the bloom and ravishment of spring" for 
all the glowing maturity of summer; we gasp with heat, we long for ices, and are planning venetian blinds; and 
three weeks ago there was snow lying beneath our garden fences, and not a leaf on the trees! In <placeName>England</placeName>, when 
Nature wakes up from her long winter, it is like a sluggard in the morning—she opens one eye and then another, 
and shivers and draws her snow coverlet over her face again, and turns round to slumber more than once, before
she emerges at last, lazily and slowly, from her winter chamber; but here, no sooner has the sun peeped through her
<pb n="224"/><seg type="pagenumber">220</seg>curtains, than up she springs, like a <roleName>huntress</roleName> for the chase, and dons her kirtle of green, and walks abroad in 
full-blown life and beauty. I am basking in her smile like an insect or a bird! Apropos to birds, we have, alas!
no singing birds in <placeName>Canada</placeName>. There is, indeed, a little creature of the ouzel kind, which haunts my garden, and has 
a low, sweet warble, to which I listen with pleasure; but we have nothing like the rich, continuous song of the 
nightingale or lark, or even the linnet. We have no music in our groves but that of the frogs, which set up such 
a shrill and perpetual chorus every evening, that we can scarce hear each other speak. The regular manner in which
the bass and treble voices respond to each other is perfectly ludicrous, so that in the midst of my impatience I
have caught myself laughing. Then we have every possible variety of note, from the piping squeak of the tree-frog,
to the deep, guttural croak, almost roar, of the bull-frog.</p> 
         <p>The other day, while walking near a piece of water, I
was startled by a very loud deep croak, as like the croak of an ordinary frog, as the bellow of a bull is like the
bleat of a calf; and looking round, perceived one of those enormous bull frogs of the country seated with great
dignity on the end of a plank, and staring at me. The monster was at least a foot in length, with a pair of eyes 
like spectacles; on shaking my parasol at him, he plunged to the bottom in a moment. They are quite harmless, I 
believe, though slander accuses them of attacking the young ducks and chickens.</p> 
         <p>It would be pleasant, verily, if, after all my
            <pb n="225"/><seg type="pagenumber">221</seg>ill-humored and impertinent <hi rend="italics">tirades</hi> against <placeName>Toronto</placeName>, I were doomed to leave it with regret; yet such is likely to be 
the case. There are some most kindhearted and agreeable people here, who look upon me with more friendliness than
at first, and are winning fast upon my feelings, if not on my sympathies. There is considerable beauty too around
me—not that I am going to give you descriptions of scenery, which are always, however eloquent, in some respect 
failures. Words can no more give you a definite idea of the combination of forms and colors in scenery, than so
many musical notes: music were, indeed, the better vehicle of the two. <persName>Felix Mendelsohn</persName>, when a child, used to 
say, "I cannot tell you how such or such a thing was—I cannot speak it—I will play it to you!" and run to his
piano: sound was then to him a more perfect vehicle than words; so, if I were a <roleName>musician</roleName>, I would <hi rend="italics">play</hi> you <placeName>Lake
   Ontario</placeName>, rather than describe it. <placeName>Ontario</placeName> means <hi rend="italics">the beautiful</hi>, and the word is worthy of its signification, and 
the lake is worthy of its beautiful name; yet I can hardly tell you in what this fascination consists: there
is no scenery around it, no high lands, no bold shores, no picture to be taken in at once by the eye; the swamp 
and the forest encloses it, and it is so wide and so vast that it presents all the monotony without the majesty
of the ocean. Yet, like that great ocean, when I lived beside it, the expanse of this lake has become to me like
the face of a friend. I have all its various <hi rend="italics">expressions</hi> by heart. I go down upon the green bank, or along the 
            <placeName>King's Pier</placeName>, which projects <seg type="pagesignature">19*</seg>
<pb n="226"/><seg type="pagenumber">222</seg>about two hundred yards into the bay. I sit there with my book, reading sometimes, but oftener watching untired 
the changeful colors as they flit over the bosom of the lake. Sometimes a thunder-squall from the west sends the 
little sloops and schooners sweeping and scudding into the harbor for shelter. Sometimes the sunset converts its 
surface into a sea of molten gold, and sometimes the young moon walks trembling in a path of silver; sometimes a 
purple haze floats over its bosom like a veil; sometimes the wind blows strong, and the wild turbid waves come 
rolling in like breakers, flinging themselves over the pier in wrath and foam, or dancing like spirits in their 
glee. Nor is the land without some charm. About four miles from <placeName>Toronto</placeName> the <placeName>river Humber</placeName> comes down between high 
wood-covered banks, and rushes into the lake: a more charming situation for villas and garden-houses could hardly 
be desired than the vicinity of this beautiful little river, and such no doubt we shall see in time.</p> 
         <p>The opposite
side of the bay is formed by a long sand-bank, called the "island," though, in fact, no island, but a very narrow 
promontory, about three miles in length, and forming a rampart against the main waters of the lake. At the extremity
is a light-house, and a few stunted trees and underwood. This marsh, intersected by inlets and covered with reeds,
is the haunt of thousands of wild fowl, and of the terapin, or small turtle of the lake; and as evening comes 
on, we see long rows of red lights from the fishing-boats gleaming along the surface of the
<pb n="227"/><seg type="pagenumber">223</seg>water, for thus they spear the lake salmon, the bass, and the pickereen.</p>
         <p>The only road on which it is possible to
take a drive with comfort is <placeName>Young-street</placeName>, which is macadamised for the first twelve miles. This road leads from
<placeName>Toronto</placeName> northwards to <placeName>Lake Simcoe</placeName>, through a well-settled and fertile country. There are some commodious, and even
elegant houses in this neighborhood. <placeName>Dundas-street</placeName>, leading west to the <placeName>London district</placeName> and <placeName>Lake Huron</placeName>, is a 
very rough road for a carriage, but a most delightful ride. On this side of <placeName>Toronto</placeName> you are immediately in the pine
forest, which extends with little interruption (except a new settlement rising here and there) for about fifty miles
to <placeName>Hamilton</placeName>, which is the next important town. The wooded shores of the lake are very beautiful, and abounding in 
game. In short a reasonable person might make himself very happy here, if it were not for some few things, among 
which, those <trait type="ethnicity"><label>Egyptian plagues</label></trait>, the flies and frogs in summer, and the relentless iron winter, are not the most 
intolerable: add, perhaps, the prevalence of sickness at certain seasons. At present many families are flying off 
to <placeName>Niagara</placeName>, for two or three days together, for change of air; and I am meditating a flight myself, of such 
serious extent, that some of my friends here laugh outright; others look kindly alarmed, and others civilly
incredulous. Bad roads, bad inns—or rather <hi rend="italics">no</hi> roads, no inns; <trait type="race"><label>wild Indians</label></trait>, and <trait type="race"><label>white men</label></trait> more <trait type="race"><label>savage</label></trait> far than
they; dangers and difficulties of every kind are threatened and prognosticated, enough
            <pb n="228"/><seg type="pagenumber">224</seg>to make one's hair stand on end. To undertake such a journey <hi rend="italics">alone</hi> is rash perhaps—yet alone it must be achieved,
            I find, or not at all; I shall have neither companion nor <roleName>man-servant</roleName>, nor <hi rend="italics">femme de chambre</hi>, nor even a
"little <roleName>foot-page</roleName>," to give notice of my fate, should I be swamped in a bog, or eaten up by a bear, or scalped,
or disposed of in some strange way; but shall I leave this fine country without seeing any thing of its great 
characteristic features?—and, above all, of its <trait type="ethnicity"><label>aboriginal inhabitants</label></trait>? Moral courage will not be wanting, 
but physical strength may fail, and obstacles, which I cannot anticipate or overcome, may turn me back; yet the
more I consider my project—wild though it be—the more I feel determined to persist. The <trait type="ethnicity"><label>French</label></trait> have a proverb 
            which does honor to their gallantry, and to which, from experience, I am inclined to give full credence—<q>"<hi rend="italics">Ce que

         <p><persName>Mr. Hepburne</persName> brought me yesterday the number of the Foreign Review for February last, which contains,
among other things, a notice of <persName>Baron Sternberg</persName>'s popular and eloquent novels. It is not very well done. 
It is true, as far as it goes; but it gives no sufficient idea of the general character of his works, some of 
which display the wildest and most playful faucy, and others again, pictures, not very attractive ones, of every
day social life.</p>
<pb n="229"/><p><seg type="pagenumber">225</seg></p><p>225 Sternberg, whom I knew in Germany, is a young nobleman of Livonia, handsome in person,
and of quiet, elegant manners. Yet I remember that in our first interview, even while he interested and fixed 
my attention, he did not quite please me ; there was in his conversation something cold, guard¬ ed, not flowing;
and in the expression of his dark, handsome features, something too invariable and cynical ; but all this
thawed or brightened away, and I became much interested in him and his works. Sternberg, as an author, may be
classed, I think, with many other accomplished and popular authors of the day, flourishing here, in France, and 
in Eng¬ land, simultaneously—signs of the times in which we live, taking the form and pressure of the age, not 
informing it with their own spirit. They are a set of men who have drunk deep, even to license, of the follies,
the pleasures, and the indulgences of so¬ ciety, even while they struggled (some of them at least) with its most
bitter, and most vulgar cares. From this gulf the intellect rises, perhaps, in all its primeval strength, the 
imagination in all its bril¬ liance, the product of both as luxuriant as ever; but we are told, " That every
gift of noble origin, Is breathed upon by Hope's perpetual breath !" And a breath of a different kind has gone
over the works of these writers—a breath as from a lazar- house. A power is gone from them which nothing can 
restore, the healthy, the clear vision, with which
a fresh, pure mind looks round upon the social and the natural world, perceiving the due relations of all 
things one with another, and beholding the " soul of goodness in things evil ;" these authors, if we are to 
believe their own account of themselves, given in broad hints, and very intelligible mysterious allu¬ sions, 
have suffered horribly from the dominion of the passions, from the mortifications of wounded self- love, betrayed 
confidence, ruined hopes, ill-directed and ill-requited affections, and a long etcetera of mi¬ series. They wish
us to believe, that in order to pro¬ duce any thing true and great in art, it is necessary to have known and gone
through all this, to have been dragged through this sink of dissipation, or this fiery furnace of suffering 
and passion. I don't know. Goethe, at least, did not think so, when he spoke of the " sort of anticipation" 
through which he produced his Götz von Berlichingen and his Werther. I hope it is not so. I hope that a
know¬ ledge of our human and immortal nature, and the due exercise of our faculties, does not depend on 
this sort of limited, unhealthy, artificial experience. It is as if a man or woman either, in order to learn 
the free, natural graceful use of the limbs, were to take lessons of a rope-dancer; but waving this, we see
in these writers, that what they call truth and experience has at least been bought rather dear ; they can 
never again, by all the perfumes of Arabia, sweeten what has been once polluted, nor take the blistering scar 
from their brow. From their works we rise with admiration, with delight, with astonish¬ ment at the talent 
displayed ; with the most excited
feelings, but never with that blameless as well as vivid sense of pleasure, that unreproved delight, that 
grateful sense of a healing, holy influence, with which we lay down Shakspeare, Walter Scott, Wordsworth, Goethe.
Yet what was hidden from these men ? Did they not know all that the world, and man, and nature could unfold? They
knew it by " anticipation," by soaring on the wings of un¬ trammelled thought, far, far above the turmoil, and
looking superior down, and with the ample ken of genius embraced a universe. These modern novel writers appear
to me in comparison like children, whose imperfect faculties and experience induce them to touch every thing 
they see ; so they burn or soil their fingers, and the blister and the stain sticks perpetual to their pages—
those pages which yet can melt, or dazzle, or charm. Nothing that is, of has been, or may be, can they see but 
through some per¬ sonal medium. What they have themselves felt, suffered, seen, is always before them, is
mixed up with their fancy, is the material of their existence, and this gives certainly a degree of vigor,
a palpa¬ ble reality, a life, to all they do, which carries us away; but a man might as well think to view 
the face of universal nature, to catch the pure, unmixed, all-embracing light of day through one of the 
gor¬ geous painted windows of Westminster Abbey, as to perceive abstract moral truth through the minds of these
writers ; but they have their use, ay, and their beauty—'like all things in the world—only I would not be one 
of such. I do not think them enviable either in themselves as individuals, or in the imme*
diate effect they produce, and the sort of applause they excite ; but they have their praise, their merit; their
use —they have their ¿ay—hereafter, perhaps, to be remembered as we remember the school of writers before the 
French revolution ; as we think of the wretched slave, or the rash diver, who from the pit or from the whirlpool
has snatched some gems worthy to be gathered into Truth's immortal treasury, or wreathed into her diadem of 
light. They have their day—how long it will last, how long they will last, is another thing. To this school of
fiction-writing belong many au¬ thors of great and various merit, and of very dif¬ ferent character and tendencies.
Some by true but partial portraitures of social evils boldly aiming at the overthrow of institutions from which
they have as individuals suffered ; others, through this medium, publicly professing opinions they would hardly
dare to promulgate in a drawing-room, and discussing questions of a doubtful or perilous tendency ; others, 
only throwing off, in a manner, the impressions of their own minds, developed in beautiful fictions, without
any ultimate object beyond that of being read with sympathy and applause—especially by women. I think Sternberg 
belongs to the latter class. He has written some most charming things. I should not exactly know where to find 
his prototype : he reminds me of Bui wer sometimes, aud one or two of his tales are in Barry St. Leger's best
manner—the eloquence, the depth of tragic and passionate inte¬ rest, are just his ; then, agaiu, others remind me of
Wilson, when he is fanciful and unearthly ; but, on the whole, his genius differs essentially from all these.
His comic and fantastic tales are exquisite. The fancy and the humor run into pathos and poetry, and never into 
caricature, like some of Hoffmann's. One of the first things I fell upon was his " Herr von Mondshein," 
(Master Moonshine,) a little jeu £ esprit, on which it seems he sets small value him¬ self, but which is an 
exquisite thing for all that—so wildly, yet so playfully, so gracefully grotesque! The effect of the whole is 
really like that of moon¬ light on a rippled stream, now seen, now lost, now here, now there—it is the moon we 
see—and then it is not * and yet it is again ! and it smiles, and it shines, and it simpers, and it glitters, 
and it is at once in heaven and on the earth, near and distant, by our side, or peeped at through an astronomer's 
telescope ; now helping off a pair of lovers—then yonder among the stars—and in the end we rub our eyes, 
and find it is just what it ought to be— all moon¬ shine / Superior and altogether different is the tale of 
" Molière," —the leading idea of which appears to me beautiful. A physician of celebrity at Paris, the inventor 
of some famous elixir—half quack, half enthusiast, and something too of a philosopher—finds himself, by some 
chance, in the parterre at the representation of one of Molière's comedies, in which the whole learned 
faculty are so exquisitely ridiculed ; the player who represents the principal character, in voi., i. 20
order to make the satire more poignant, arrays himself in the habitual dress of Tristan Dieu- donné ; the 
unfortunate doctor sees himself repro¬ duced on the stage with every circumstance of ig¬ nominious ridicule, 
hears around him the loud ap¬ plause, the laugh of derision—meets in every eye the mocking glance of recognition 
; his brain turns, and he leaves the theatre a raving maniac. (So far the tale is an " o'er true tale.") By 
degrees this frenzy subsides into a calmer but more hopeless, more melancholy madness ; he shuts himself up
from mankind, at one time sinking into a gloomy des¬ pondency, at another revelling in projects of ven¬ geance 
against Molière, his enemy and destroyer. One only consolation remains to him ; in this misera¬ ble, abject state,
a charitable neighbor comes to vi¬ sit him daily ; by degrees wins upon the affections, and gains the confidence 
of the poor madman— soothes him, cheers him, and performs for him all tender offices of filial love ; and this 
good Samaritan is of course the heart-stricken, remorseful poet, Molière himself. There is a love-story interwoven 
of no great in¬ terest, and many discussions between the poet and the madman, on morals, medicine, philosophy : 
that in which the insane doctor endeavors to prove that many of his patients who appear to be living are in reality 
dead, is very striking and very true to nature î shows how ingenious metaphysical madness can sometimes be. Other 
known personages, as Boileau, Chapelain» Racine, are introduced in person, and give us their
opinions on poetry, acting, the fine arts, with consi¬ derable discrimination, in the characters of the speakers. 
The scenes of Parisian society in this novel are not so good ; rather heavy and Germanesque—cer¬ tainly not French. 
" Lessing" is another tale in which Sternberg has taken a real personage for his hero. He says that he has endeavored,
in these two tales, to delineate the strife which a man whose genius is in advance of the age in which he lives,
must carry on with all around him. They may be called biographical novels. # * # * " Galathée," Sternberg's last
novel, had just made its appearance when I was at Weimar ; all the wo¬ men were reading it and commenting on it—some
in anger, some in sorrow, almost all in admiration. It is allowed to be the finest thing he has done in point of 
style. To me it is a painful book. It is the history of the intrigues of a beautiful coquette and a Jesuit priest 
to gain over a young <trait type="religion"><label>Protestant</label></trait> nobleman from his faith and his betrothed love. They prove but too successful. In
the end he turns Roman Catholic, and forsakes his bride. The he¬ roine, Galathée, dies quietly of a broken heart. 
" The more fool she !" 1 thought, as I closed the book, " to die for the sake of a man who was not worth living for !"
but " 'tis a way we have." Sternberg's women—his virtuous women especi¬ ally, (to be sure he is rather sparing of
them,)— have always individual character, and are touched
with a firm, a delicate, a graceful pencil ; but his men are almost without exception vile, or insipid, or eccentric—
and his heroes (where could he find them ?) are absolutely characterless —as weak as they are detestable. 
Sternberg possesses, with many other talents, that of being an accomplished amateur artist. He sketches 
charmingly and with enviable facility and truth catches the characteristic forms both of persons and things.
Then he has all the arcana of a lady's toilette at the end of his pencil, and his glance is as fastidious as 
it is rapid in detecting any peculiarity of dress or manner. Whenever he came tous he used to ask for some white
paper, which, while he talked or listened; he covered with the prettiest sketches and fancies imaginable; but 
whether this was to employ his fingers, or to prevent me from looking into his eyes while he spoke, I was never 
quite sure. This talent for drawing—this lively sense of the picturesque in form and color, we trace through 
all his works. Some of the most striking passages— those which dwell most strongly on the memory— are pictures. 
Thus the meeting of Molière and the Doctor in the church-yard at dusk of evening, the maniac seated on the grave,
the other standing by, wrapped in his flowing mantle, with his hat and feather pulled over his brow, and bending 
over his victim with benevolent expression, is what painters call a fine " bit of effect." The scene in the
half- lighted chapel, where the beautiful Countess Meli- certe is doing penance, and receiving on her naked
shoulders the scourge from the hand ofher confessor, is a very powerful but also a very disagreeable piece of 
painting. The lady in crimson velvet seated on the ground en Madelene, with her silver crucifix on her knees 
and her long dark jewelled tresses flowing dishevelled, is a fine bit of color, and the court ballet in the
gardens of the Favorita Talace a per¬ fect Watteau. Reading very fine, eloquent, and vivid descriptions of 
nature and natural scenery, by writers who give us licentious pictures of social life in a narrow, depraved,
and satirical spirit, is very disagreeable—it always leaves on the mind an, impression of discord and unfitness. 
And this dis-. crepancy is of perpetual recurrence in Sternberg,, and in other writers of his class. But it is in
the tale entitled Die Gebrüder Breu-i ghel (the Two Breughels) that Sternberg has aban-. doned himself con amore
to all his artist-like feelings and predilections. The younger Breughel (known by the names of Höllen Breughel 
and the " Mad Painter," on account of the diabolical subjects in which his pencil revelled,) is the hero of 
this re¬ markable tale : forsaking the worship of beauty, he paid a kind of crazed adoration to deformity, and 
painted his fantastic and extravagant creations with truly demoniac skill and power. Sternberg makes the cause 
of this eccentric perversion of genius a love-affair, which has turned the poor painter's wits " the seamy side
without," and rendered him the apostate to all that is beautiful in nature and art. This love-tale, however, 
occupies little of the inte¬ rest. The charm of the whole consists in the lively 20*
sketches of Flemish art, and the characteristic por¬ traits of different well-known artists : we have the gay, 
vivacious Teniers—the elegant and somewhat affected Poelenberg—the coarse, good-humored Jordaens —Peter Laers, 
the tavern-keeper—the grave yet splendid coxcombry of the „Velvet Breughel—his eccentric, half-crazed brother,
the Hero—old Peter Kock, with his color mania, (the Turner of his day,) and presiding over alL the noble, the 
magnificent Peter Paul Rubens, and the digni¬ fied, benevolent Burgomaster Hubert, the patron of art: all 
these are brought together in groups, and admirably discriminated. In this tale, Sternberg has. most ingeniously
transferred to his pages some celebrated and well-known pictures as actual scenes ; and- thus Painting pays back
part of her debt to Poetry and Fiction. The Alchymist in his labora¬ tory—the Gambling Soldiers—the Boors and 
Beg¬ gars at cards—the Incantation in the Witch's Tower -!—the Burning. Mill—the Page asleep in the Ante¬ chamber—
and the Country Merrymaking—are each a Rembrandt, a Jordaens, an Ostade, a Peter Laers, a Breughel, or a Teniers,
transferred from the can¬ vass to the page, and painted in words almost as brilliant and lively as the original 
colors. I doubt whether a. translation of this clever tale would, please generally in England ;. it is too dis¬ 
cursive and argumentative. It requires a familiar knowledge of art and artists, as well as a feeling for art, to
enter into it, for it is almost entirely devoid of any interest arising from incident or passion. Yet I sat, up
till after two o'Hock this morning to
finish it, wasting my eyes over the small type, like a most foolish improvident woman.
As the rolling stone gathers no moss, so the roving heart gathers no affections.
I have met with certain minds which seem never to be themselves penetrated by truth, yet have the power to 
demonstrate clearly and beautifully to other minds, as there are certain substances which most brightly reflect,
and only partially absorb, the rays of light.
Reading what Charles Lamb says on the " sanity of true genius," it appears to me that genius and sanity have nothing 
(necessarily) to do with each other. Genius may be combined with a healthy or a morbid organization. Shakspeare, 
Walter Scott, Goethe, are examples of the former : Byron, Col¬ lins, Kirke White, are examples of the latter.
A man may be as much a fool from the want of sensibility as the want of sense.
How admirable what Sir James Mackintosh says of Madame de Maintenon !—that " she was as vir¬ tuous as the fear 
of hell and the fear of shame could make her." The same might be said of the virtue of many women I know, and of
these, I be¬ lieve that more are virtuous from the fear of shame than the fear of hell.—Shame is the woman's hell.
Rahel* said once of an acquaintance, " Such a one is an ignorant man. He knows nothing but what he has learned,
and that is little, for a man can only learn that which man already knows."—Well, and truly, and profoundly said !
Every faculty, every impulse of our human na¬ ture, is useful, available, in proportion as it is dan¬ gerous.
The greatest blessings are those which may be perverted to most pain : as fire and water are the two most 
murderous agents in nature, and the two things in which we can least endure to be stinted.
Who that has lived in the world, in society, and looked on both with observing eye, but has often
been astonished at the fearlessness of women, and the cowardice of men, with regard to public opinion ? The 
reverse would seem to be the natu¬ ral, the necessary result of the existing order of things, but it is not 
always so. Exceptions occur so often, and so immediately within my own pro¬ vince of observation, that they 
have made me reflect a good deal. Perhaps this seeming discrepancy might be thus explained. Women are brought
up in the fear of opinion, but from their ignorance of the world, they are in fact ignorant of that which they 
fear. They fear opinion as a child fears a spectre, as something shadowy and horrible, not defined or palpable.
It is a fear based on habit, on feeling, not on principle or reason. When their passions are strongly excited, 
or when reason becomes matured, this exaggerated fear vanishes, and the probability is, that they are imme¬ diately
thrown into the opposite extreme of incre¬ dulity, defiance and rashness : but a man, even while courage is
preached to him, learns from habitual intercourse with the world, the immense, the terrible power of opinion.
It wraps him round like despo¬ tism ; it is a reality to him ; to a woman a shadow, and if she can overcome the 
fear in her own person, all is overcome. A man fears opinion for himself, his wife, his daughter; and if the fear 
of opinion be brought into conflict with primary sentiments and principles, it is ten to one but the habit of
fear prevails, and opinion triuinphs oyer reason and feel¬ ing top.
The new law passed during the last session of our provincial parliament, " to render the remedy in cases of 
seduction more effectual," has just come into operation. What were the circumstances which gave rise to this 
law, and to its peculiar provisions, I cannot learn. Here it is touching on delicate and even for¬ bidden 
ground to ask any questions. One person said that it was to guard against infanticide ; and I recollect 
hearing the same sort of argument used in London against one particular clauseofthe new Poor Law Act, viz.
that it would encourage infanticide. This is the most gross and unpardonable libel on our sex ever uttered. 
Women do not murder their children from the fear of want, but from the fear of shame. In this fear, substituted
for the light and the strength of virtue and genuine self-respect, are women trained, till it becomes a second 
nature—not indeed stronger than the natural instincts and the passions which God gave us, but strong enough to
drive to madness and delirious outrage the wretched victim who. finds the struggle between these contradictory
feelings too great for her conscience, her reason, her strength. Nothing, as it seems to me, but throwing the
woman upon her own self-respect and added responsibility, can bring a remedy to this fearful state of things. 
To say that the punishment of the fault, already too great, is thereby increased, is not true ; it admitted of 
no real increase. In entailing irremediable disgrace, and death of name and fame, upon the frail woman, the law
of society had done its utmost ; and to let it be supposed that the man had power to make
amends by paying a nominal tax for indulgence bought at such a tremendous price, what was it but to flatter and
delude both the vanity of lordly, sensual man, and the weakness of wretched, igno¬ rant, trusting woman? As long
as treachery to woman is honorable in man ; as long as men do not, or will not protect us ; as long as we women 
cannot protect ourselves, their protecting laws are a farce and a mockery. Opinion has ever been stronger than 
law. Luckily there is something stronger than either.</p>

<p><date when="1837-06-13">June 13</date>.</p> 
<p>In these latter days I have lived in friendly communion with so many exellent people, that my departure from <placeName>Toronto</placeName> 
was not what I anticipated—an escape on one side, or a riddance on the other. My projected tour to the west 
excited not only some interest, but much kind solicitude; and aid
<pb n="244"/><seg type="pagenumber">240</seg>and counsel were tendered with a feeling which touched me deeply. The <roleName>chief justice</roleName>, in particular, sent me a
whole sheet of instructions, and several letters of introduction to settlers along my line of route. <persName>Fitzgibbon</persName>,
always benevolent, gave me sensible and cheerful encouragement as we walked leisurely down to the pier, to embark
in the steamboat which was to carry me across the lake to <placeName>Niagara</placeName>.</p>
         <p>And here I might moralize on the good 
            effects of being <hi rend="italics">too</hi> early instead of too late on a journey: on the present occasion, having a quarter of 
an hour or twenty minutes to spare proved the most important and most fortunate circumstance which could have
occurred at my outset.</p> 
         <p>The first bell of the steam-boat had not yet rung, when my good friend <persName>Dr. Rees</persName> came running
            up to tell me that the <roleName>missionary</roleName> from the <placeName>Sault St.Marie</placeName>, and his <trait type="race"><label>Indian wife</label></trait>, had arrived at <placeName>Toronto</placeName>, and 
were then at the inn, and that there was just time to introduce me to them. No sooner thought than done: in
another moment we were in the hotel, and I was introduced to <persName>Mrs. Mac Murray</persName>, other- wiseO-ge-ne-bu-go-quay,
            (i. e. <hi rend="italics">the wild rose</hi>.)</p> 
         <p>I must confess that the specimens of <trait type="race"><label>Indian squaws</label></trait> and <trait type="ethnicity"><label>half-cast women</label></trait> I had met with,
had in no wise prepared me for what I found in <persName>Mrs. MacMurray</persName>. The first glance, the first sound of her voice,
struck me with a pleased surprise. Her figure is tall—at least it is rather above than below the middle size,
with that indescribable grace and undulation of movement which speaks the perfection
            <pb n="245"/><seg type="pagenumber">241</seg>of form. Her features are distinctly <trait type="race"><label>Indian</label></trait>, but softened and refined, and their expression at once bright and
kindly. Her dark eyes have a sort of fawn-like shyness in their glance, but her manner, though timid, was quite 
free from embarrassment or restraint. She speaks <trait type="ethnicity"><label>English</label></trait> well, with a slightly <trait type="ethnicity"><label>foreign intonation</label></trait>, not the less
            pleasing to my ear that it reminded me of the voice and accent of some of my <trait type="ethnicity"><label>German friends</label></trait>. In two minutes I 
was seated by her—my hand kindly folded in hers— and we were talking over the possibility of my plans. It seems
there is some chance of my reaching the <placeName>Island of Michillimackinac</placeName>, but of the <placeName>Sault St. Marie</placeName>, I dare hardly 
think as yet—it looms in my imagination dimly described in far space, a kind of Ultima Thule; yet the sight of 
<persName>Mrs. MacMurray</persName> seemed to give something definite to the vague hope which had been floating in my mind. Her 
            sister, she said, was married to the <trait type="race"><label>Indian agent</label></trait> at Michillimackinac,* a man celebrated in the <placeName>United States</placeName> 
for his scientific researches; and from both she promised me a welcome, should I reach their island. To her 
own far-off home at the <placeName>Sault St. Marie</placeName>, between <placeName>Lake Huron</placeName> and <placeName>Lake Superior</placeName>, she warmly invited me—without, 
however, being able to point out any conveyance or mode of travel thither that could be depended on—only a
possible chance of such. Meantime, there was some hope of our meeting somewhere on the road, but it was of 
the faintest. She thanked me feelingly for the interest I
            <seg type="footnote"><persName>Henry Schoolcraft, Esq.</persName></seg>
            <seg type="pagesignature">VOL. IV.</seg>
            <pb n="246"/><seg type="pagenumber">242</seg>took in her own <trait type="ethnicity"><label>fated race</label></trait>, and gave me excellent hints as to my manner of proceeding. We were in the full tide 
of conversation when the bell of the steam-boat rang for the last time, and I was hurried off. On the deck of 
the vessel I found her <roleName type="family">husband,</roleName> <persName>Mr. MacMurray</persName>, who had only time to say, in fewest words, all that was proper,
polite, and hospitable. This rencontre, which some would call accidental, and some providential, pleased and
encouraged me, and I felt very grateful to <persName>Dr. Rees</persName>.</p> 
         <p>Then came blessings, good wishes, kind pressures of the hand, 
and last adieus, and waving of handkerchiefs from the shore, as the paddles were set in motion, and we glided
swiftly over the mirror-like bay, while "there was not a breath the blue waves to curl."</p> 
         <p>I bad not been happy 
enough in <placeName>Toronto</placeName> to regret it as a place; and if touched, as I truly was, by the kind solicitude of those
friends who, but a few weeks ago, were entire strangers to me, I yet felt no sorrow. Though no longer young,
I am quite young enough to feel all the excitement of plunging into scenes so entirely new as were now opening 
before me; and this, too, with a specific object far beyond mere amusement and excitement—an object not unworthy.</p>
<p>But though the spirit was willing and cheerful, I was under the necessity of remembering that I was not all spirit,
but clogged with a material frame which required some looking after. My general health had suffered during the 
long trying winter, and it was judiciously suggested that I should spend
<pb n="247"/><seg type="pagenumber">243</seg>a fortnight at the <placeName>falls of Niagara</placeName> to recruit, previous to my journey. The good sense of this advice I could not 
appreciate at the time, any more than I could anticipate the fatigues and difficulties which awaited me; but my 
good angel, in the shape of a certain languid inclination for silence and repose whispered me to listen and
obey—fortunately, or providentially. Meantime I was alone—alone—and on my way to that ultimate somewhere of 
which I knew nothing, with forests, and plains, and successive seas intervening. The day was sultry, the air 
heavy and still, and a strange fog, or rather a series of dark clouds, hung resting on the bosom of the lake,
which in some places was smooth and transparent as glass—in others, little eddies of wind had ruffled it into
tiny waves, or welts rather—so that it presented the appearance of patchwork. The <roleName>boatmen</roleName> looked up and foretold
a storm; but when we came within three or four miles from the mouth of the river <placeName>Niagara</placeName>, the fog drew off like
a curtain, and the interminable line of the dark forest came into view, stretching right and left along the whole
horizon; then the white buildings of the <trait type="ethnicity"><label>American fort</label></trait>, and the spires of the <placeName>town of Niagara</placeName>, became visible
against the rich purple-green back-ground and we landed after a four hours' voyage. The threatened storm came 
on that night. The summer storms of <placeName>Canada</placeName> are like those of the tropics; not in <placeName>Italy</placeName>, not among the <placeName>Appenines</placeName>,
where I have in my time heard the <q>"live thunder leaping from crag to crag,"</q> did I ever hear such terrific 
explosions of sound as burst over our heads this night. The
<pb n="248"/><seg type="pagenumber">244</seg>silence and the darkness lent an added horror to the elemental tumult—and for the first time in my life I felt
sickened and unpleasantly affected in the intervals between the thunder-claps, though I cannot say I felt fear. 
Meantime the rain fell as in a deluge, threatening to wash us into the lake, which reared itself up, and roared—like
a monster for its prey.</p>
         <p>Yet the next morning, when I went down upon the shore, how beautiful it looked—the 
hypocrite I—there it lay rocking and sleeping in the sunshine, quiet as a cradled infant. <placeName>Niagara</placeName>, in its 
girdle of verdure and foliage, glowing with fresh life, and breathing perfume, appeared to me a far different
place from what I had seen in winter. Yet I recollect, as I stood on the shore, the effect produced on my 
mind by the sound of the death-bell pealing along the sunny blue waters. They said it was tolled for a young
man of respectable family, who, at the age of three or four and twenty, had died from habitual drinking; 
his elder brother having a year or two before fallen from his horse in a state of intoxication, and perished 
in consequence. Yes, every thing I see and hear on this subject convinces me that it should be one of the 
first objects of the government to put down, by all and every means, a vice which is rotting at the core of
this infant society—poisoning the very sources of existence. But all their taxes, and prohibitions, and excise 
laws, will do little good, unless they facilitate the means of education. In society the same evening, the 
appearance of a very young, very pretty, sad-looking creature, with her first baby at her bosom, whose
<pb n="249"/><seg type="pagenumber">245</seg><roleName type="family">husband</roleName> was staggering and talking drunken gibberish at her side, completed the impression of disgust and
affright with which the continual spectacle of this vile habit strikes me since I have been in this country.</p> 
<p>In the dockyard here, I was glad to find all in movement; a steamer was on the stocks, measuring one hundred 
and twenty-nine feet in length, and twenty in the beam; also a large schooner; and all the brass-work and 
casting is now done here, which was formerly executed at <placeName>Montreal</placeName>, to the manifest advantage of the province,
as well as the town. And I have been assured, not only here but elsewhere, that the work turned out is excellent
—of the first order.</p>
         <p>In the jail here, a <roleName>wretched maniac</roleName> is confined in chains for murdering his <roleName type="family">wife.</roleName> He was 
convicted, condemned to death, and on the point of being hung; for though the <roleName>physician</roleName> believed the man mad,
he could not prove it in evidence: he appeared rational on every subject. At length, after his condemnation,
the <roleName>physician</roleName>, holding his wrist, repeated the religious Orange toast—something about the <roleName>Pope</roleName> and the devil;
and instantly, as he expressed it, the man's pulse bounded like a shot under his fingers, and he was seized with 
a fit of frenzy. He said that his <roleName type="family">wife</roleName> had been possessed by the seven deadly sins, and he had merely given her
seven kicks to exorcise her—and thus he murdered the poor woman. He has been in the jail four years, and is
now more mad, more furious, than when first confined. This I had from the <roleName>physician</roleName> himself. <seg type="pagesignature">21*</seg>
<pb n="250"/><seg type="pagenumber">246</seg>Before quitting the subject of <placeName>Niagara</placeName>, I may as well mention an incident which occurred shortly afterwards, 
on my last visit to the town, which interested me much at the time, and threw the whole of this little community
into a wonderful ferment. A <trait type="ethnicity"><label>black man</label></trait>, a <roleName>slave</roleName> somewhere in <placeName>Kentucky</placeName>, having been sent on a message, mounted on
a very valuable horse, seized the opportunity of escaping. He reached <placeName>Buffalo</placeName> after many days of hard riding, 
            sold the horse, and escaped beyond the lines into <placeName>Canada</placeName>. Here, as in all the <trait type="ethnicity"><label>British dominions</label></trait>, God be praised!
the <roleName>slave</roleName> is <roleName>slave</roleName> no more, but free, and protected in his freedom.* This man acknowledged that he had not been 
ill treated; he had received some education, and had been a favorite with his <roleName>master</roleName>. He gave as a reason for 
his flight, that he had long wished to marry, but was resolved that his <roleName type="family">children</roleName> should not be born <roleName>slaves</roleName>. In 
<placeName>Canada</placeName>, a <roleName>runaway slave</roleName> is assured of legal protection; but, by an international compact between the <placeName>United 
States</placeName> and our provinces, all <roleName>felons</roleName> are mutually surrendered. Against this young man the <roleName>jury</roleName> in <placeName>Kentucky</placeName> had 
found a true bill for horse-stealing; as a <roleName>felon</roleName>, therefore, he was pursued, and, on the proper legal requisition,
            arrested; and then lodged in the <placeName>jail of Niagara</placeName>, to be given up to his <roleName>master</roleName>, who, with an <trait type="ethnicity"><label>American constable</label></trait>, 
was in readiness
            <seg type="footnote">Among the addresses presented to <persName>Sir Francis Head,</persName> in <date>1836,</date> was one from the <roleName>colored inhabitants</roleName> of this part of the province,
               signed by four hundred and thirty-one individuals, most of them <roleName>refugees</roleName> from the <placeName>United States,</placeName> or their descendants.</seg>
<pb n="251"/><seg type="pagenumber">247</seg>to take him into custody, as soon as the government order should arrive. His case excited a strong interest 
            among the <trait type="race"><label>whites</label></trait>, while the <trait type="ethnicity"><label>colored populalation</label></trait>, consisting of many hundreds in the districts of <placeName>Gore</placeName> 
and <placeName>Niagara</placeName>, chiefly <roleName>refugees</roleName> from the <placeName>States</placeName>, were half frantic with excitement. They loudly and openly 
declared that they would peril their lives to prevent his being carried again across the frontiers, and 
surrendered to the vengeance of his angry <roleName>master</roleName>. Meantime there was some delay about legal forms, and 
the <roleName>mayor</roleName> and several of the inhabitants of the town, united in a petition to the <roleName>governor</roleName> in his favor. 
In this petition it was expressly mentioned that the <roleName>master</roleName> of the <roleName>slave</roleName> had been heard to avow that his 
            intention was not to give the <roleName>culprit</roleName> up to justice, but to make what he called an <hi rend="italics">example</hi> of him. Now there
had been lately some frightful instances of what the <roleName>slave proprietors</roleName> of the south called <q>"making an 
example;"</q> and the <roleName>petitioners</roleName> entreated the <roleName>governor</roleName> to interpose, and save the man from a torturing 
death <q>"under the lash or at the stake."</q> Probably the <roleName>governor</roleName>'s own humane feelings pleaded even more strongly
in behalf of the poor fellow. But it was a case in which he could not act from feeling, or, <q>"to do a great 
right, do a little wrong."</q> The law was too expressly and distinctly laid down, and his duty as <roleName>governor</roleName> was 
clear and imperative—to give up the <roleName>felon</roleName>, although, to have protected the <roleName>slave</roleName>, he would, if necessary, 
have armed the province.</p> 
         <p>In, the mean time the <trait type="ethnicity"><label>colored people</label></trait> assembled
            <pb n="252"/><seg type="pagenumber">248</seg>from the adjacent villages, and among them a great number of their women. The conduct of this <trait type="ethnicity"><label>black mob</label></trait>, 
animated and even directed by the females, was really admirable for its good sense, forbearance, and resolution.
They were quite unarmed, and declared their intention not to commit any violence against the <trait type="ethnicity"><label>English law</label></trait>. The 
<roleName>culprit</roleName>, they said, might lie in the jail, till they could raise among them the price of the horse; but if any
attempt were made to take him from the prison, and send him aross to <placeName>Lewiston</placeName>, they would resist it at the 
hazard of their lives.</p>
         <p>The fatal order <hi rend="italics">did</hi> at length come; the <roleName>sheriff</roleName> with a party of <roleName>constables</roleName> prepared
            to enforce it. The <trait type="ethnicity"><label>blacks</label></trait>, still unarmed, assembled round the jail, and waited till their <roleName>comrade</roleName>, or their 
<roleName>brother</roleName> as they called him, was brought out and placed handcuffed in a cart. They then threw themselves 
simultaneously on the <roleName>sheriff</roleName>'s party, and a dreadful scuffle ensued; the <roleName>artillery men</roleName> from the little 
fort, our only military, were called in aid of the civil authority, and ordered to fire, on the <roleName>assailants</roleName>. 
            Two <trait type="ethnicity"><label>blacks</label></trait> were killed, and two or three wounded. In the melée the poor <roleName>slave</roleName> escaped, and has not since been 
retaken, neither was he, I believe, pursued.</p>
         <p>But it was the conduct of the women which, on this occasion, excited 
the strongest surprise and interest. By all those passionate and persuasive arguments that a woman knows so 
well how to use, whatever be her color, country, or class, they had prevailed on their <roleName type="family">husbands, brothers,</roleName> and 
lovers, to use no arms, to do no illegal violence, but to lose
<pb n="253"/><seg type="pagenumber">249</seg>their lives rather than see their <roleName>comrade</roleName> taken by force across the lines. They had been most active in the fray,
            throwing themselves fearlessly between the <trait type="ethnicity"><label>black men</label></trait> and the <trait type="race"><label>whites</label></trait>, who, of course, shrank from injuring them. 
One woman had seized the <roleName>sheriff</roleName>, and held him pinioned in her arms; another, on one of the <roleName>artillery-men</roleName> 
presenting his piece, and swearing that he would shoot her if she did not get out of his way, gave him only 
one glance of unutterable contempt, and with one hand knocking up his piece, and collaring him with the other,
held him in such a manner as to prevent his firing. I was curious to see a <trait type="ethnicity"><label>mulatto woman</label></trait> who had been foremost 
in the fray, and whose intelligence and influence had mainly contributed to the success of her people; and young 
<persName>Mr. M ------</persName>, under pretence of inquiring after a sick child, drove me round to the hovel in which she lived, 
outside the town. She came out to speak to us. She was a fine creature, apparently about five-and-twenty, with 
a kindly animated countenance; but the feelings of exasperation and indignation had evidently not yet subsided.
She told us, in answer to my close questioning, that she had formerly been a <roleName>slave</roleName> in <placeName>Virginia</placeName>; that, so far 
from being ill-treated, she had been regarded with especial kindness by the family on whose estate she was
born. When she was about sixteen her <roleName>master</roleName> died, and it was said that all the <roleName>slaves</roleName> on the estate would be
sold, and therefore she ran away. "Were you not attached to your <roleName>mistress</roleName>?" I asked. "Yes," said she, 
"I liked my <roleName>mistress</roleName>, but I did not like to be sold." I asked her if she was happy here in <placeName>Canada</placeName>?
            <pb n="254"/><seg type="pagenumber">250</seg>She hesitated a moment, and then replied, on my repeating the question, "Yes—that is, I <hi rend="italics">was</hi> happy here—but 
            now—I don't know—I thought we were safe <hi rend="italics">here</hi>—I thought nothing could touch us <hi rend="italics">here</hi>, on your <trait type="ethnicity"><label>British ground</label></trait>,
but it seems I was mistaken, and if so I won't stay here—I won't—I won't! I'll go and find some country where 
they cannot reach us! I'll go to the end of the world, I will!" And as she spoke, her black eyes flashing, she
extended her arms, and folded them across her bosom, with an attitude and expression of resolute dignity, which
a <roleName>painter</roleName> might have studied; and truly the fairest <trait type="race"><label>white face</label></trait> I ever looked on never beamed with more of soul 
and high resolve than hers at that moment.</p>
<pb n="255"/><p><seg type="pagenumber">251</seg></p>
<p>Between the town of <placeName>Queenston</placeName> and the cataract of <placeName>Niagara</placeName> lies the pretty village of <placeName>Stamford</placeName>, (close to <placeName>Lundy 
   Lane</placeName>, the site of a famous battle in the last war,) and celebrated for its fine air. Near it is a beautiful
house with its domain, called <placeName>Stamford Park</placeName>, built and laid out by a former <roleName>governor</roleName> (<persName>Sir Peregrine Maitland</persName>.)
   It is the only place I saw in <placeName>Upper Canada</placeName> combining our ideas of an elegant, well-furnished <trait type="ethnicity"><label>English villa</label></trait> and
ornamented grounds, with some of the grandest and wildest features of the forest scene. It enchanted me 
altogether. From the lawn before the house, an open glade, commanding a park-like range of broken and 
undulating ground and wooded valleys, displayed beyond them the wide expanse of <placeName>Lake Ontario</placeName>, even the <placeName>Toronto
light-house</placeName>, at a distance of thirty miles, being frequently visible to the naked eye. By the <roleName>hostess</roleName> of this
charming seat I was conveyed in a light pony carriage to the hotel at <placeName>the Falls</placeName>, and left, with real kindness, 
to follow my own devices. The moment I was alone, I hurried down to the <placeName>Table-rock</placeName>. The body of water was more 
full and tremendous than in the winter. The spray rose, densely falling again in thick showers, and behind 
those rolling volumes of vapor the last gleams of the evening light shone in lurid brightness, amid amber and
crimson clouds; on the other side, night was rapidly coming on, and all was black, impenetrable
<pb n="256"/><seg type="pagenumber">252</seg>gloom, and <q>"boundless contiguity of shade."</q> It was very, very beautiful, and strangely awful too! For now 
it was late, and as I stood there, lost in a thousand reveries, there was no human being near, no light but 
that reflected from the leaping, whirling foam; and in spite of the deep-voiced continuous thunder of the 
cataract, there was such a stillness that I could hear my own heart's pulse throb—or did I mistake feeling
for hearing?—so I strayed homewards, or housewards I should say, through the leafy, gloomy, pathways—wet 
with the spray and fairly tired out.</p><!-- Horizontal line -->
<p>Two or three of my <placeName>Toronto</placeName> friends are here, and declare against my projects of solitude. To-day we had a 
   beautiful drive to <persName>Colonel Delatre</persName>'s. We drove along the road <hi rend="italics">above</hi> <placeName>the Falls</placeName>. There was the wide river 
spreading like a vast lake, then narrowing, then boiling, foaming along in a current of eighteen miles an 
hour, till it swept over the <placeName>Crescent rock</placeName> in a sheet of emerald green, and threw up the silver clouds of 
spray into the clear blue sky. The fresh luxurious verdure of the woods, relieved against the dark pine forest,
added to the beauty of scene. I wished more than ever for those I love most!—for some one who would share all
this rapture of admiration and delight, without the necessity of speaking—for after all, what are words? 
They express nothing, reveal nothing, avail nothing. So it all sinks back into my own heart, there to be kept
<pb n="257"/><seg type="pagenumber">253</seg>quiet. After a pleasant dinner and music, I returned to the hotel by the light of a full moon, beneath which 
<placeName>the Falls</placeName> looked magnificently mysterious, part glancing silver light, and part dark shadow, mingled with 
fleecy folds of spray, over which floated a soft, sleepy gleam; and in the midst of this tremendous 
velocity of motion and eternity of sound, there was a deep, deep repose, as in a dream. It impressed me 
for the time like something supernatural—a vision, not a reality.</p><!-- Horizontal line -->
<p>The good people, <roleName>travellers</roleName>, <roleName>describers</roleName>, <roleName>poets</roleName>, and others, who seem to have hunted through the dictionary 
for words in which to depict these cataracts under every aspect, have never said enough of the rapids 
above—even for which reason, perhaps, they have struck me the more; not that any words in any language 
would have prepared me for what I now feel in this wondrous scene. Standing to-day on the banks above the
<placeName>Crescent Fall</placeName> near <placeName><persName>Mr. Street</persName>'s mill</placeName>, gazing on the rapids, they left in my fancy two impressions which seldom
meet together—that of the sublime and terrible, and that of the elegant and graceful—like a tiger at play. 
I could not withdraw my eyes; it was like a fascination.</p>
         <p>The verge of the rapids is considerably above the eye;
the whole mighty river comes rushing over the brow of a hill, and as you look up, it seems coming down to 
overwhelm you. Then meeting with the rocks, as it pours down the declivity, it boils and <seg type="pagesignature">vol. i. 22</seg>
 <pb n="258"/><seg type="pagenumber">254</seg>frets like the breakers of the ocean. Huge mounds of water, smooth, transparent and gleaming like the emerald, 
or rather like the more delicate hue of the chrysopaz, rise up and bound over some unseen impediment, then break
into silver foam, which leaps into the air in the most graceful fantastic forms; and so it rushes on, whirling,
boiling, dancing, sparkling along, with a playful impatience, rather than overwhelming fury, rejoicing as if 
escaped from bondage, rather than raging in angry might—wildly, magnificently beautiful! The idea, too, of the
immediate danger, the consciousness that any thing caught within its verge is inevitably hurried to a swift
destination, swallowed up, annihilated, thrills the blood; the immensity of the picture, spreading a mile at
least each way, and framed in by the interminable forests, adds to the feeling of grandeur: while the giddy,
infinite motion of the headlong waters, dancing and leaping, and revelling and roaring, in their mad glee,
gave me a sensation of rapturous terror, and at last caused a tension of the nerves in my head, which obliged
me to turn away.</p>
         <p>The great ocean, when thus agitated by conflicting winds or opposing rocks, is a more tremendous
thing, but it is merely tremendous—it makes us think of our prayers; whereas, while I was looking on these
rapids, beauty and terror, power and joy, were blended, and so thoroughly, that even while I trembled and 
admired, I could have burst into a wild laugh, and joined the dancing billows in their glorious, fearful mirth—</p>
<pb n="259"/><lg><l>Leaping like Bacchanals from rock to rock,</l> 
           <l>Flinging the frantic Thyrsus wild and high!</l> </lg>
            <p>I shall never see again,
or feel again, aught like it—never! I did not think there was an object in nature, animate or inanimate, that 
could thus over—set me <hi rend="italics">now</hi>!</p>
 <pb n="260"/><p><seg type="pagenumber">256</seg></p><p>I have only three books with me here, besides the one book needful, and find them sufficient for all pur¬ poses
—Shakspeare, Schiller, Wordsworth. One morning, being utterly disinclined for all effort, either of conversation 
or movement, I wandered down to a little wild bosquet beyond the Table- rock, not very accessible to dilettante 
hunters after the picturesque, and just where the waters, ren¬ dered smooth by their own infinite velocity, were
sweeping by, before they take their leap into the gulf below ;-r- there I sat all the sultry noontide— quiet, 
among the birds and the thick foliage, and read through Don Carlos—one of the finest dramas in the world, I 
should think. It is a proof of the profound humanity of Schiller, that in this play one must needs pity King 
Philip, though it is in truth the sort of pity which Saint Theresa felt for the devil —one pities him because
he is the devil. The pitiableness and the misery of wickedness were never so truly and so pathetically 
demonstrated. The unfathomable abyss of egotism in the character turns one giddy to look into. With regard 
to Posa, it has been objected, I be¬ lieve—for 1 never read any criticism on this play—- that he is a mere
abstraction, or rather the embodied mouthpiece of certain abstract ideas of policy and • religion and morals
—those of Schiller himself—and notan individual human being—in short, an impossi-
bility. Yet, why so ? Perhaps such a man as Posa never did exist ;—but why impossible ? Can a man conceive
that which a man could not by possibility be ? If Schiller were great enough to invent such a character, 
is not humanity great enough to rea¬ lize it ? My belief is, that it is only a glorious anti¬ cipation—that
poets in some sort are the prophets of perfection—that Schiller himself might have been a Posa, and, had
he lived a century or two hence, would have been a Posa. Is that a mere abstrac¬ tion which while I read, 
makes me thrill, tremble, exult, and burn, and on the stage filled my eyes with most delicious tears ? Is that
a mere abstrac¬ tion which, excites our human sympathies in the strongest, highest degree ? Every woman, 
me¬ thinks, would like a Posa for a lover—at least, if I could love, it would be such a man. The notion that
Posa could not by possibility exist in the court of Philip II. appears to me unfounded, for such a court
would be just the place where such a charac¬ ter would be needed, and by reaction produced : extremes meet.
Has not the Austrian court in these days, produced Count Auersperg, the poet of freedom, who has devoted his
whole soul, his genius, and his gift of song, to the cause of humanity and liberty ? Francis the First and
Metternich, and the dungeons of the Spielberg, have as naturally pro¬ duced an Auersperg, as Philip and the
Autos-da-Fe in Flanders might have produced a Posa. It may be said that the moral unity and consis¬ tency of
the character of Posa is violated by that lie which he tells to save the life of Carlos. 22*
Posa is living in an atmosphere of falsehood ; the existence and honor of Carlos are about to be sacri¬ ficed
by a lie, and Роза, by another lie, draws the vengeance of the king upon himself; Magnanima menzogna! or 
quando è il vero Sı bello, che si possa a te preporrei —But the effect of this " rrragnanimous"~ falsehood 
is like that of ftZZ falsehood, evil. This one devia¬ tion from the clear straight line of truth not only
fails of its purpose, but plunges Carlos, the queen, and Posa himself, in the same abyss of destruction. It was
the opinion of---------, with whom I read this play in Germany, that the queen (Elizabeth of France, Philip's
second wife) is a character not de¬ fined, nat easily understood—that there is a myste¬ ry about her intended
by the author. I do not see the character in this point of view. It does not seem to me that Schiller meant 
her to be any thing but what she appears. There is no mask here, conscious or unconscious ; in such a mind her
love for Don Carlos is not a feeling combated, struggled with, but put out of her mind altogether, as a thing 
which ought not to be thought of, ought not to ex¬ ist, and therefore ceases to exist ;—a tender, per¬ fectly
pure interest in the happiness and the fate of Don Carlos remains ; but this is all ; she does not cheat 
herself nor us with verbal virtue. The cloud¬ less, transparent, crystalline purity of the character is 
its greatest charm, it will be said perhaps, that if we see the whole —if there be indeed nothing veiled,
beyond or beneath what is visible and spoken, then it is sludlow. Not so—but, like perfectly limpid
water, it seems shallower than it is. The mind of a woman, which should be wholly pure, simple, and true,
would produce this illusion : we see at once to the bottom, whether it be shining pebble or golden sands, 
and do not perceive the true depth till we try, and are made to feel and know it by getting beyond our own
depth before we are aware. Such a character is that of Elizabeth of France. The mannerin which she rebukes
the passionate ravings of Carlos—the self-confiding simplicity—the dig¬ nity without assumption—the virtue,
so clothed in innocence as to be almost unconscious—all is most beautiful, and would certainly lose its charm
the moment we doubted its truth —the moment we sus¬ pected that the queen was acting a forced or a con¬ scious
part, however virtuous. The scene in which Elizabeth repels the temptation of the Duke of Alva and the monk 
might be well contrasted with the similar scene between Catherine of Arragon and the two cardinals in Shakspeare.
Elizabeth has a passive, graceful, uncontending pride of vir¬ tue, which does not assert itself, only guards 
itself. Her genuine admiration of Posa, and the manner in which, in the last scene, you see the whole soft,
feminine being, made up of affections, tears, and devotion, develope itself to be caught and crushed as in an
iron vice, renders this delineation, delicate as it is in the conception, and subordinate in inte¬ rest, one 
of the finest I have met with out of Shak¬ speare, and comparable only to his Hermione in the beauty and singleness
of the conception. When I saw Don Carlos performed at Vienna>
with a perfection and ensemble of which our stage affords few examples, it left, as a work of art, an impression
of a moral kind, at once delightful and elevating, which I cannot easily forget. I was never more touched, more
excited, by any dramatic representation that I can remember. Korn, allow¬ ed to be one of their finest actors, 
played Posa magnificently ; and it seemed to be no slight pri¬ vilege to tread the stage butforthree hours, 
clothed in such god-like attributes—to utter, in words eloquent as music, the sentiments of a man —sentiments 
and aspirations that, in every thrilling heart, found at least a silent echo—sentiments which, if uttered or 
written off the stage, would have brought down upon him the surveillance of the secret police, or the ban of the 
censor. Fichtner played Don Carlos with impassioned youthful sensibility ; and though I heard it objected by the 
Princess H ---------, that he had not suffi¬ ciently l'air noble, it did not strike me. Karl La Roche, an actor 
formed under Goethe's tuition, in the golden age of the Weimar theatre, played Phi¬ lip II., and looked, and 
dressed, and acted the cha¬ racter with terrible and artist-like fidelity. Made¬ moiselle Fournier, one of the most
beautiful women I ever beheld, and a clever actress, was admirable in the Princess Eboli. Mademoiselle Peche, also
a good actress, failed in the queen, as at the time I felt rather than thought, for I had not well considered the
character. She embodied too formally, per¬ haps intentionally, the idea of something repressed and concealed with
effort, which I do not find in,
<pb n="265"/><seg type="pagenumber">261</seg>Schiller's Elizabeth. On this representation occur¬ red an incident worth noting The old Emperor Francis was present
in his box, looking, as usual, very heavy-headed and attentive ; it was about a month or six weeks before his death.
In the scene where Posa expostulates with King Philip, pleads eloquently for toleration and liberty, and at length,
throwing himself at his feet, exclaims, <q>" Geben Sie uns Gedankenfreiheit !"</q> the audience, that is, the parterre, 
applauded ; and there were around me, cries, not loud butdeep, of "Bravo, Schiller!" After this the performance
of Don Carlos was forbidden, and it was not given again while I was at Vienna. # # * # #</p> 
<p>This I write for your
edification before I go to rest, after a day of much quiet enjoyment and luxurious indolence. The orb of the
moon new risen is now suspended upon the very verge of the <trait type="ethnicity"><label>American fall</label></trait>, just opposite to my balcony; the

views of the two cataracts be here wonderfully grand and beautiful, and the bridge across the rapids a sort 
of miracle, as they
   <pb n="266"/><seg type="pagenumber">262</seg>say, still it is not altogether to be compared to the <trait type="ethnicity"><label>Canadian shore</label></trait> for picturesque scenery. The <trait type="ethnicity"><label>Americans</label></trait> 
have disfigured their share of the rapids with mills and manufactories, and horrid red brick houses, and other
unacceptable, unseasonable sights and signs of sordid industry. Worse than all is the round tower, which 
some profane wretch has erected on the <placeName>Crescent Fall</placeName>; it stands there so detestably impudent and <hi rend="italics">mal-à-propos</hi> 
   —it is such a signal yet puny monument of bad taste—so miserably <hi rend="italics">mesquin</hi>, and so presumptuous, that I do

one of these fine days, though indeed a barrel of gunpowder were a shorter if not a surer method. Can 
you not send us out some <persName>Guy Faux</persName>, heroically ready to be victimized in the great cause of insulted nature, 
and no less insulted art?—But not to tire you with descriptions of precipices, caves, rocks, woods, and 
rushing waters, which I can buy here ready made for sixpence, I will only tell you that our party was very 
pleasant.</p>
         <p><persName>Colonel Delatre</persName> is a <roleName>veteran officer</roleName>, who has purchased a fine lot of land in the neighborhood, 
has settled on it with a very interesting family, and is cultivating it with great enthusiasm and success. 
He served for twenty years in <placeName>India</placeName>, chiefly in the <placeName>island of Ceylon</placeName>, and was present at the capture of that 
amiable despot, the <roleName>king of Candy</roleName>—he who had such a penchant for pounding his subjects in a mortar. He gave 
            me some anecdotes of this savage war, and of <trait type="race"><label>Oriental life</label></trait>, which were very
            <pb n="267"/><seg type="pagenumber">263</seg>amusing. After answering some questions relative to the condition of the <trait type="ethnicity"><label>European women</label></trait> in <placeName>Ceylon</placeName>, and the 
            manners and morals of the <trait type="race"><label>native women</label></trait>, <persName>Colonel Delatre</persName> said, with unaffected warmth, "I have seen much hard
service in different climates, much of human nature in <trait type="race"><label>savage</label></trait> and <trait type="race"><label>civilized</label></trait> life, in the east and in the 
west, and all I have seen has raised your sex generally in my estimation. It is no idle compliment—I speak 
from my hearts I have the very highest idea of the worth and capabilities of women, founded on experience,
but, I must say, the highest pity too! You are all in a false position; in <placeName>England</placeName>, in <placeName>Ceylon</placeName>, in <placeName>America</placeName>
—every where I have found women alike in essentials, and alike ill treated, in one way or in another!"</p>
         <p> The people who have spoken or written of these <placeName>Falls of Niagara</placeName>, have surely never done justice to their loveliness,
their inexpressible, inconceivable beauty. The feeling of their beauty has become with me a deeper feeling than
that of their sublimity. What a scene this evening! What splendor of color! The emerald and chrysopaz 
of the transparent waters, the dazzling gleam of the foam, and the snow-white vapor on which was displayed 
the most perfect and gigantic iris I ever beheld—forming not a half, but at least two-thirds of an entire
circle, one extremity resting on the lesser (or <trait type="ethnicity"><label>American</label></trait>) <placeName>Fall</placeName>, the other in the very lap of the <placeName>Crescent Fall</placeName>, 
spanning perhaps half a mile, perfectly resplendent in hue—so gorgeous, so vivid, and yet so ethereally 
delicate, and apparently within
<pb n="268"/><seg type="pagenumber">264</seg>a few feet of the eye; the vapors rising into the blue heavens at least four hundred feet, three times the 
height of <placeName>the Falls</placeName>, and tinted rose and amber with the evening sun; and over the woods around every possible
variety of the richest foliage—no, nothing was ever so transendently lovely! The effect, too, was so grandly 
uniform in its eternal sound and movement, it was quite different from that of those wild, impatient, 
tumultuous rapids. It soothed, it melted, it composed, rather than excited.</p>
         <p>There are no water-fowl now as
in the winter—when driven from the ice-bound shores and shallows of the lake, they came up here to seek their
food, and sported and wheeled amid the showers of spray. They have returned to their old quiet haunts; 
sometimes I miss them: they were a beautiful variety in the picture.</p>
         <p>How I wish for those I love to enjoy
all this with me! I am not enough in myself to feel it all. I cannot suffice for it all, without some 
sympathy to carry off this <q>"superflu d'ame et de vie;"</q> it overwhelms, it pains me. Why should I not 
            go down <hi rend="italics">now</hi> to the <placeName>Table-rock</placeName> or to the river's brink below <placeName>the Falls</placeName>—now when all is still and solitary,
and the rich moonlight is blending heaven and earth, and the vapors, and woods, and waters, in shadowy 
splendor? All else in nature sleeps—all but those ever-bounding and rejoicing waters, still holding on their
way, ceaseless, exhaustless, without pause or rest. I look out with longing and wakeful eye, but it is 
midnight, and 1 am alone; and if I do not
<pb n="269"/><seg type="pagenumber">265</seg>feel fear, I feel at least the want of a supporting arm, the want of a sustaining heart. So to bed, to be
hushed to slumber by that tremendous lullaby.</p>
<p><title>A DREAM.</title></p> 
         <p>Very significant, poetical, allegorical dreams have often been invented or dreamt with open eyes;
but once I had a singular dream, which was a real dream of sleep—such a one as, if I had lived in the days 
of <persName>Pharaoh</persName> or <persName>Nebuchadnezzar</persName>, I should have sent for the nearest magician or prophet to interpret. I remember
no vision of the night which ever left on my waking fancy so strong, so vivid an impression; but 
unfortunately the beginning and the end of the vision faded before I could collect the whole in my remembrance.</p>
<p>I had been reading over, late in the evening, <persName>Sternberg</persName>'s <hi rend="italics">Herr von Mondshein</hi>, and in sleep the impression 
   continued. I dreamed I was reading a volume of <trait type="ethnicity"><label>German tales</label></trait>, and as I read, it seemed as if, by a strange, 
dream-like, double power of perception, not only the words before me, but the forms and feelings they 
expressed, became visible and palpable to sense. What I read seemed to act itself before my eyes. It was
a long history, full óf fantastic shapes and perplexing changes, and things that seemed and were not; but,
finally, one image predominated and dwelt on my memory clearly and distinctly, even long after I waked. 
It was that of a Being, I know not of what nature or sex, which <seg type="pagesignature">vol. i. 23</seg>
<pb n="270"/><seg type="pagenumber">266</seg>went up and down upon our world lamenting—for it loved all things, suffered with all things, sympathized 
with all things; and a crowd of all sentient creatures followed—men, women, and <roleName type="family">children,</roleName> and animals— 
a mournful throng.</p>
         <p>And the Being I have mentioned looked round upon them, and feeling in itself all their
miseries, desires, and wants, wept and wrung its hands.</p>
         <p>And at length a wish arose in the heart of that 
Being to escape from the sight of sorrow and suffering which it could share and not alleviate; and 
with this wish it looked up for a moment towards heaven, and a cup was held forth by a heavenly hand—a 
charmed cup, by which the secret wish was fulfilled, and the Being drank of this cup.</p>
         <p>And then, I know 
not how, all ihings changed. And I saw the same Being standing upon a high altar, in an illuminated temple.
The garments were floating in light. The arms were extended towards heaven; the eyes ever upwards turned; 
but there was no hope or rapture in those eyes; on the contrary, they were melancholy, and swimming in 
tears. And around the altar was the same crowd of all human and sentient beings, and they looked up constantly
with clasped hands, and with a sad and anxious gaze, imploring one of those looks of sympathy and tenderness 
to which they had been accustomed—but in vain.</p>
         <p>And I looked into the heart of that Being which stood alone 
upon the altar, and it was also sad, and full of regret and love towards the earth, and vain longing to look
down once more on those creatures:
<pb n="271"/><seg type="pagenumber">267</seg>but the consecrating spell was too strong; the eyes remained ever directed towards heaven, and the arms 
were extended upwards; and the bond which had united the sympathizing with the suffering heart was broken
for ever.</p>
         <p>I do not mean to tell you that I dreamed all this to the sound of the <placeName>Falls of Niagara</placeName>; but I do
            aver that it was a real <hi rend="italics">bona fide</hi> dream. Send me now the interpretation thereof—or look to be sphinx-devoured.</p>

         <p>Returned from <placeName>Stamford Park</placeName>, where I spent a few days rather agreeably, 
            for there were books, music and mirth within, though a perpetual storm raged without.</p> <p>* * * *</p> 
         <p>The distance
from <placeName>the Falls</placeName> is four miles, and the hollow roar of the cataract not only sounded all night in my ears, 
but violently shook doors and windows. The very walls seemed to vibrate to the sound.</p>
         <p>I came back to the 
<placeName>Clifton Hotel</placeName>, to find my beautiful <placeName>Falls</placeName> quite spoiled and discolored. Instead of the soft aquamarine 
hue, relieved with purest white, a dull dirty brown now imbued the waters. This is owing to the shallowness
of <placeName>Lake Erie</placeName>, where every storm turns up the muddy bed from the bottom, and discolors the whole river. 
The spray, instead of
<pb n="272"/><seg type="pagenumber">268</seg>hovering in light clouds round and above the cataracts, was beaten down, and rolled in volumes round their
base; then by the gusty winds driven along the surface of the river hither and thither, covering every 
thing in the neighborhood with a small rain. I sat down to draw, and in a moment the paper was wet through.
It is as if all had been metamorphosed during my absence—and I feel very disconsolate.</p><!-- Horizontal line -->
<p>There are, certainly, two ways of contemplating the sublime and beautiful. I remember one day, as I was
   standing on the <placeName>Table-rock</placeName>, feeling very poetical, an <trait type="ethnicity"><label>Irishman</label></trait> behind me suddenly exclaimed, in a most
cordial brogue, and an accent of genuine admiration—"Faith, then, that's a pretty dacent dhrop o' water
that's coming over there!"</p>
<pb n="273"/><p><seg type="pagenumber">269</seg></p><p><date when="1837-06-19">June 19</date>.</p> 
         <p>That you may have some understanding of my whereabouts, my outgoings, and my incomings, I intend
this to be a chapter on localities; and putting poetry and description far from me, I now write you a 
common sensible lecture on topography and geography. It is no unpardonable offence, I hope, to suppose you 
as ignorant as I was myself, till I came here.</p>
         <p>Perhaps even for my sake you may now and then look upon a map
of <placeName>Canada</placeName>, and there, as in the maps of <placeName>Russia</placeName> in <persName>Catharine the Second</persName>'s time, you will find not a few 
towns and cities laid down by name which you might in vain look for within the precincts of the province,
seeing that they are non-extant, as yet, at least, though full surely <hi rend="italics">to be</hi>, some time or other, somewhere 
or other, when this fair country shall have fair play, and its fair quota of population. But from this 
anticipation I would willingly except a certain City of <placeName>the Falls</placeName> which I have seen marked on so many 
maps, and mentioned in so many books, as already laid out and commenced, that I had no doubt of its 
existence till I came here for the first time last winter. But here it is not—<hi rend="italics">Grazie a Dio!</hi>—nor likely
to be, as far as I can judge, for a century to come. Were a city to rise here, it would necessarily become 
a manufacturing place, because of the <q>"water powers and privileges,"</q> <seg type="pagesignature">23*</seg>
<pb n="274"/><seg type="pagenumber">270</seg>below and above the cataract, which would then be turned to account. Fancy, if you can, a range of
cotton factories, iron foundries, grist mills, saw mills, where now the mighty waters rush along in glee 
and liberty—where the maple and the pine woods now bend and wave along the heights. Surely they have done
enough already with their wooden hotels, museums, and curiosity stalls: neither in such a case were red 
brick tenements, gas-lights, and smoky chimneys, the worst abomination to be feared. There would be a moral
pollution brought into this majestic scene, far more degrading; more than all those rushing waters, with
their <q>"thirteen millions of tons per minute,"</q> could wash away.</p>
         <p>Let us pray against such a desecration. In 
            the mean time can you tell me who was the first <trait type="race"><label>white man</label></trait> whose eyes beheld this wonder of the earth? He was
            a <trait type="ethnicity"><label>Frenchman</label></trait>, but nowhere do I find record of his name, nor of the impressions which such a discovery would
make on any, even the most vulgar and insensible nature.</p>
               <p>In former seasons, the two boteis have been full to 
overflowing. They tell me here that last summer one hundred and fifty persons sat down almost daily to dinner; 
the far greater number were <roleName>travellers</roleName> and <roleName>visiters</roleName> from the <placeName>United States</placeName>. This year, owing to the commercial
embarrassments of that country, there are so few visiters, that one hotel (<placeName>Forsyth</placeName>'s) is closed, and the other
(<placeName>Clifton House</placeName>) is nearly empty, to the serious loss, I fear, of the poor people, but to myself individually an
<pb n="275"/><seg type="pagenumber">271</seg>unspeakable comfort—for thus I wander about and drive about in full liberty and loneliness.</p>
               <p>The whole of this 
district between the two great lakes is superlatively beautiful, and was the first settled district in 
<placeName>Upper Canada</placeName>; it is now the best cultivated. The population is larger in proportion to its extent than that
of any other district. In <placeName>Niagara</placeName>, and in the neighboring district of <placeName>Gore</placeName>, many fruits come to perfection, which
are not found to thrive in other parts of the province, and cargoes of fruit are sent yearly to the cities 
of <placeName>Lower Canada</placeName>, where the climate is much more severe and the winter longer than with us.</p>
               <p>On the other side
the country is far less beautiful and they say less fertile, but rich in activity and in population; and there
are within the same space at least half a dozen flourishing towns. Our speculating energetic <trait type="ethnicity"><label>Yankee neighbors</label></trait>, 
not satisfied with their <placeName>Manchester</placeName>, their manufactories, and their furnaces, and their mill "privileges," 
have opened a railroad from <placeName>Lewiston</placeName> to <placeName>Buffalo</placeName>, thus connecting <placeName>Lake Erie</placeName> with the <placeName>Erie Canal</placeName>. On our side, 
we have the <placeName>Welland Canal</placeName>, a magnificent work, of which the province is justly proud; it unites <placeName>Lake Erie</placeName> with
<placeName>Lake Ontario</placeName>.</p>
              <p>Yet from <placeName>the Falls</placeName> all along the shores of the <placeName>Lake Erie</placeName> to the <placeName>Grand River</placeName> and far beyond it, the
only place we have approaching to a town is <placeName>Chippewa</placeName>, just above the rapids, as yet a small village, but lying 
                 immediately in the road from the <placeName>Western States</placeName> to <placeName>the Falls</placeName>. From <placeName>Buffalo</placeName> to this place the <trait type="ethnicity"><label>Americans</label></trait> run a 
steamboat daily; they
<pb n="276"/><seg type="pagenumber">272</seg>have also planned a suspension bridge across the <placeName>Niagara river</placeName>, between <placeName>Lewiston</placeName> and <placeName>Queenston</placeName>. Another village,
<placeName>Dunnville</placeName>, on the <placeName>Grand River</placeName>, is likely to be the commercial depot of that part of the province; it is 
situated where the <placeName>Welland Canal</placeName> joins <placeName>Lake Erie</placeName>.</p>
         <p>As the weather continued damp and gloomy, without hope of 
change, a sudden whim seized me to go to <placeName>Buffalo</placeName> for a day or two; so I crossed the turbulent ferry to 
<placeName>Manchester</placeName>, and thence an engine, snorting, shrieking like fifty tortured animals, conveyed us to <placeName>Tonawando</placeName>,*
            once a little village of <trait type="ethnicity"><label>Seneca Indians</label></trait>, now rising into a town of some size and importance; and there to my
great delight I encountered once more my new friends, <persName>Mr. and Mrs. MacMurray</persName>, who were on their return from 
<placeName>Toronto</placeName> to the <placeName>Sault St. Marie</placeName>. We proceeded on to <placeName>Buffalo</placeName> together, and during the rest of the day had some
pleasant opportunities of improving our acquaintance.</p>
         <p><placeName>Buffalo</placeName>, as all travel-books will tell you, is a very 
fine young city, about ten years old, and containing already about twenty thousand <roleName>inhabitants</roleName>. There is here
the largest and most splendid hotel I have ever seen, except at <placeName>Frankfort</placeName>. Long rows of magnificent houses
—not of painted wood, but of brick and stone—are rising on every side.</p>
         <p>The season is unusually dull and dead, and I hear
            <seg type="footnote">Near this place lived and died the <persName><roleName>chief</roleName> Red-jacket,</persName> 
               one of the last and greatest specimens of the <trait type="ethnicity"><label>Indian</label></trait><roleName>patriot</roleName> and <roleName>warrior.</roleName> </seg>
            <pb n="277"/><seg type="pagenumber">273</seg>nothing but complaints around me; but compared to our sleepy <trait type="ethnicity"><label>Canadian shore</label></trait>, where a lethargic spell seems 
to bind up the energies of the people, all here is bustle, animation, activity. In the port I counted about 
fifty vessels, sloops, schooners, and steam-boats; the crowds of people buying, selling, talking, bawling;
the <trait type="race"><label>Indians</label></trait> lounging by in their blankets, the men looking so dark, and indifferent, and lazy; the women so 
busy, care-worn, and eager; and the quantities of <roleName type="family">sturdy children,</roleName> squalling, frisking among the feet of
busy <roleName>sailors</roleName>—formed altogether a strange and amusing scene.</p>
         <p>On board the <placeName>Michigan</placeName> steamer, then lying ready 
for her voyage up the lakes to <placeName>Chicago</placeName>, I found all the arrangements magnificent to a degree I could not have
anticipated. This is one of the three great steam-boats navigating the <placeName>Upper Lakes</placeName>, which are from five to seven
hundred tons burthen, and there are nearly forty smaller ones coasting <placeName>Lake Erie</placeName>, between <placeName>Buffalo</placeName> and <placeName>Detroit</placeName>,
besides schooners. We have (in <date>1837</date>) on this lake two little ill-constructed steamers, which go puffing up and
            down like two little tea-kettles, in proportion to the gigantic <trait type="ethnicity"><label>American boats</label></trait>; and unfortunately, till our 
side of the lake is better peopled and cultivated, we have no want of them. When they are required, they 
will exist, as on <placeName>Lake Ontario</placeName>, where we have, I believe, eight or ten steamers.</p>
         <p>I found here several good 
            <roleName>booksellers</roleName>' shops, the counters and shelves loaded with <trait type="ethnicity"><label>cheap American editions</label></trait> of <trait type="ethnicity"><label>English publications</label></trait>, generally of a
 <pb n="278"/><seg type="pagenumber">274</seg>trashy kind, but some good ones; and it is not a pleasing fact that our two <roleName>booksellers</roleName> at <placeName>Toronto</placeName> are principally
supplied from this place. When I wanted a book at <placeName>Toronto</placeName> which was not forthcoming, the usual answer was, 
"that it would be sent for from <placeName>Buffalo</placeName>." The clothing and millinery shops were the best and gayest in appearance.
In the window of one of the largest of these I saw written up in large letters, "Walk in, and name your price!"
Over the door of another was inscribed, "Book and bandbox store." I marvelled what could bring these apparently 
heterogeneous articles into such close emulation and juxtaposition, till I remembered—that both are made of 
paper.</p>
         <p>The <persName>MacMurrays</persName>, with their beautiful infant and his <trait type="race"><label>Indian nurse</label></trait>, embarked on board the <placeName>Michigan</placeName>, and 
I parted from them with regret, for <persName>Mrs. MacMurray</persName> had won upon me more and more with her soft voice and her 
benign eyes, and her maternal anxieties.</p>
         <p>I was now again alone, in a vast inn, swarming with dirty, lazy, 
smoking men—the rain was falling in a deluge, and no books—no companions. As I walked disconsolately up and 
down a great room, they call in <trait type="ethnicity"><label>American hotels</label></trait> the ladies' parlor, a young girl, very pretty and well dressed,
who was swinging herself in a rocking-chair, and reading <persName>Mrs. Hemans</persName>, rose from her seat, left the room without
saying a word, and returned with a handful of books, and several numbers of an excellent literary periodical, "
The Knickerbocker, of <placeName>New-York</placeName>," which she most courteously placed before
<pb n="279"/><seg type="pagenumber">275</seg>me. A cup of water in a desert could hardly have been more welcome, or excited warmer thanks and gratitude. Thus
charitably furnished with amusement, the gloomy wet morning did at last glide away, for time and the hour 
will creep through the dullest, as they "run through" the roughest day. In the evening I went to the theatre,
to a private box, a luxury which I had not expected to find in this most democratical of cities. The theatre 
is small of course, but very neat and prettily decorated. They had an <roleName>actress</roleName> from <placeName>New-York</placeName> <hi rend="italics">starring</hi> it here for
a few nights, the tallest, handsomest woman I ever saw on the stage, who looked over the head of her diminutive
<persName>Romeo</persName>, or down upon him—the said <persName>Romeo</persName> being dressed in the costume of <persName>Othello</persName>, turban and all. When in the
balcony, the rail did not reach up to <persName>Juliet</persName>'s knees, and I was in perpetual horror lest she should topple
down headlong. This would have been the more fatal, as she was the only one who knew any thing of her part.
The other <roleName>actors</roleName> and <roleName>actresses</roleName> favored us with a sort of gabble, in which not only <persName>Shakspeare</persName>, but numbers,
sense, and grammar, were equally put to confusion. <persName>Mercutio</persName> was an enormously corpulent man with a red nose,
who swaggered about and filled up every hiatus of memory with a good round oath. The whole exhibition was so 
inexpressibly ludicrous, that I was forced to give way to fits of uncontrollable laughter—whereat my companions
looked not well pleased. Nor was the audience less amusing than the dramatis personae: the pit was filled by 
<roleName>artisans</roleName> of the lowest grade, and <roleName>lake mariners</roleName>
<pb n="280"/><seg type="pagenumber">276</seg>sitting in their straw hats and shirt-sleeves—for few had either coats or waistcoats. They were most devoutly
attentive to the story in their own way, eating cakes and drinking whiskey between the acts, and whenever any
thing especially pleased them, they uttered a loud whoop and halloo, which reverberated through the theatre, 
at the same time slapping their thighs and snapping their fingers. In their eyes, <persName>Peter</persName> and the <roleName>nurse</roleName> were 
evidently the <roleName>hero</roleName> and <roleName>heroine</roleName> of the piece, and never appeared without calling forth the most boisterous 
            applause. The <roleName>actor</roleName> and <roleName>actress</roleName> had enriched the humor of <persName>Shakspeare</persName> by adding several <trait type="ethnicity"><label>Yankee witticisms</label></trait> and
allusions, the exact import of which I could not comprehend; but they gave unqualified delight to the merry 
parterre. I did not wait for the second entertainment, having some fear that as the tragedy had proved a 
farce, the farce might prove a tragedy.</p>
         <p>The next morning I returned to <placeName>the Falls</placeName>, which are still sullen and 
turbid, owing to the stormy weather on <placeName>Lake Erie</placeName>.</p>

         <p>In a strange
country, much is to be learned by travelling in the public carriages: in <placeName>Germany</placeName> and elsewhere I have preferred
this mode of conveyance, even when the alternative lay within my choice, and I never had reason to regret it.</p>
         <p>The <trait type="ethnicity"><label>Canadian stage-coaches</label></trait>* are like those of the <trait type="ethnicity"><label>United States</label></trait>, heavy, lumbering vehicles, well calculated to 
live in roads where any decent carriage must needs founder. In one of these I embarked to return to the town of
<placeName>Niagara</placeName>, thence to pursue my journey westward: a much easier and shorter course had been by the lake steamers;
but my object was not haste, nor to see merely sky and water, but to see the country.</p>
         <p><seg type="footnote">That is, the better class of them. In some parts of <placeName>Upper Canada,</placeName>
            the stage-coaches conveying the mail were large, oblong wooden boxes, 
            formed of a few planks nailed together and placed on wheels, into which you entered by the windows,
            there being no doors to open and shut, and no springs. Two or three seats were suspended inside on leather straps. 
            The <roleName>travellers</roleName> provided their own buffalo-skins or cushions to sit on.</seg></p>
         <pb n="282"/><p><seg type="pagenumber">278</seg></p><p>In the stage-coach two persons were already seated—an <trait type="ethnicity"><label>English emigrant</label></trait> and his <roleName type="family">wife,</roleName> with whom I quickly made
acquaintance after my usual fashion. The circumstances and the story of this man I thought worth noting—not because
there was any thing uncommon or peculiarly interesting in his case, but simply because his ease is that of so 
many others; while the direct good sense, honesty and intelligence of the man pleased me exceedingly.</p> 
         <p>He told me that he bad come to <placeName>America</placeName> in his own behalf and that of several others of his own class—men who had each 
            a large family and a small capital, who found it difficult to get <hi rend="italics">on</hi> and settle their <roleName type="family">children</roleName> in <placeName>England</placeName>. In his
own case, he had been some years ago the only one of his trade in a flourishing country town, where he had now
fourteen <roleName>competitors</roleName>. Six families, in a similar position, had delegated him on a voyage of discovery: it 
was left to him to decide whether they should settle in the <placeName>United States</placeName> or in the <placeName>Canadas</placeName>; so leaving his <roleName type="family">children</roleName>
at school in <placeName>Long Island</placeName>, "he was just," to use his own phrase, "taking a turn through the two countries, to
            look about him and gather information before he decided, and had brought his little <roleName type="family">wife</roleName> to see the grand <placeName>Falls 
of Niagara</placeName>, of which he had heard so much in the <placeName>old country</placeName>."</p> 
         <p>As we proceeded, my companion mingled with his 
acute questions, and his learned calculations on crops and prices of land, certain observations on the beauty 
of the scenery, and talked of lights and shades, and foregrounds, and effects, in very homely,
            <pb n="283"/><seg type="pagenumber">279</seg><trait type="ethnicity"><label>plebeian English</label></trait>, but with so much of real taste and feeling, that I was rather astonished, till I found he 
had been a <roleName>print-seller</roleName> and <roleName>frame-maker</roleName>, which last branch of trade had brought him into contact with <roleName>artists</roleName> 
and <roleName>amateurs</roleName>; and he told me, with no little exultation, that among his stock of moveables, he had brought out 
with him several fine drawings of <persName>Prout</persName>, <persName>Hunt</persName>, and even <persName>Turner</persName>, acquired in his business. He said he had no 
wish at present to part with these, for it was his intention, wherever he settled, to hang them up in his house,
though that house were a log hut, that his <roleName type="family">children</roleName> might have the pleasure of looking at them, and learn to 
distinguish what is excellent in its kind.</p> 
         <p>The next dey, on going from <placeName>Niagara</placeName> to <placeName>Hamilton</placeName>, in a storm of rain,
            I found, to my no small gratification, the <trait type="ethnicity"><label>English emigrant</label></trait> and his quiet, silent little <roleName type="family">wife,</roleName> already seated in 
            the stage, and my only <hi rend="italics">compagnons de voyage</hi>. In the deportment of this man there was that deferential courtesy
which you see in the manners of <roleName>respectable tradesmen</roleName>, who are brought much into intercourse with their superiors 
in rank, without, however, a tinge of servility; and his conversation amused and interested me more and more. 
He told me he had been born on a farm, and had first worked as a <roleName>farmer</roleName>'s boy, then as a <roleName>house-carpenter</roleName>, lastly,
as a <roleName>decorative carver</roleName> and <roleName>gilder</roleName>, so that there was no kind of business to which he could not readily turn his
            hand. His <roleName type="family">wife</roleName> was a good <roleName>sempstress</roleName>, and be had brought up all his <roleName type="family">six children</roleName> to be useful, giving them such 
opportunities of acquiring knowledge as he could.
<pb n="284"/><seg type="pagenumber">280</seg>He regretted his own ignorance, but, as he said, he had been all his life too busy to find time for reading much.
He was, however, resolved that his boys and girls should read, because, as he well observed, "every sort of knowledge,
be it much or little, was sure to turn to account some time or other." His notions on education, his objections 
to the common routine of common schools, and his views for his <roleName type="family">children,</roleName> were all marked by tha same originality 
and good sense. Altogether he appeared to be, in every respect, just the kind of <roleName>settler</roleName> we want in <placeName>Upper Canada</placeName>.
I was therefore pleased to hear that hitherto he was better satisfied with the little he had seen of this province,
than with those states of <placeName>the Union</placeName> through which he had journeyed; he said, truly, it was more "home-like, more
            <trait type="ethnicity"><label>English-like</label></trait>." I did my best to encourage him in this favorable opinion, promising myself that the little I 
might be able to do to promote his views, that I would do.* </p> 
         <p>While the conversation was thus kept up with wonderful
pertinacity, considering that our vehicle was reeling and tumbling along the detestable road, pitching like a
scow among the breakers in a lake
<seg type="footnote">And I did my best, in referring him by letter to
   <persName>Dr. Dunlop;</persName> for, though personally unknown to him, I knew that my emigrant was exactly
   the man to deserve and obtain his notice. I also wrote to <persName><roleName>Chief</roleName> Justice Robinson</persName> in his favor,
   and invited him to come to us on his arrival in <placeName>Toronto,</placeName> promising him the <roleName>Chancellor's</roleName> good-will and assistance.
   But I never heard of the man again, nor could I find, before I left <placeName>Canada,</placeName> that his name was registered as a purchaser of land.</seg> 
<pb n="285"/><seg type="pagenumber">281</seg>storm, our driver stopped before a vile little log hut, over the door of which hung crooked-wise a board, setting 
forth that "wiskey and tabacky" were to be had there. The windows were broken, and the loud voice of some intoxicated
wretch was heard from within, in one uninterrupted torrent of oaths and blasphemies, so shocking in their variety,
and so new to my ears, that I was really horror-struck.</p> 
         <p>After leaving the hut, the coach stopped again. I called
to the <roleName>driver</roleName> in some terror, "You are not surely going to admit that drunken man into the coach?" He replied
coolly, "О no, I an't; don't you be afear'd!" In the next moment he opened the door, and the very wretch I 
stood in fear of was tumbled in head foremost, smelling of spirits, and looking—О most horrible! Expostulation 
was in vain. Without even listening, the driver shut the door, and drove on at a gallop. The rain was at this time
falling in torrents, the road knee-deep in mud, the wild forest on either side of us dark, grim, impenetrable.
Help there was none, nor remedy, nor redress, nor hope, but in patience. Here, then, was one of those inflictions 
to which <roleName>speculative travellers</roleName> are exposed now and then, appearing, <hi rend="italics">for the time</hi>, to outweigh all the possible
advantages of experience or knowledge bought at such a price.</p>
         <p>I had never before in my whole life been 
obliged to endure the presence or proximity of such an object for two minutes together, and the astonishment,
horror, disgust, even to sickness and loathing, which it now inspired, are really unspeakable. The <trait type="ethnicity"><label>Englishman</label></trait>,
            placing himself in the middle seat, in front <seg type="pagesignature">24*</seg>
            <pb n="286"/><seg type="pagenumber">282</seg>of his <roleName type="family">wife</roleName> and myself, did his best to protect us from all possibility of contact with the object of our 
abomination; while the wretched being, aware of our adverse feeling, put on at one moment an air of chuckling 
self-complacency, and the next glared on us with ferocious defiance. When I had recovered myself sufficiently 
to observe, I saw, with added horror, that he was no more than five-and-twenty, probably much younger, with a
face and figure which must have been by nature not only fine, but uncommonly fine, though now deformed, degraded,
haggard and inflamed with filth and inebriety—a dreadful and humiliating spectacle. Some glimmering remains of 
sense and decency prevented him from swearing and blaspheming when once in the coach; but he abused us horribly:
his nasal accent, and his drunken objurgations against the <placeName>old country</placeName>, and all who came from it, betrayed his own 
birth and breeding to have been on the other side of the <placeName>Niagara</placeName>, or "down east." Once he addressed some words to
me, and, offended by my resolute silence, he exclaimed, with a scowl, and a hiccup of abomination at every word,
"I should like—to know—madam—how—I came under your diabolical influence?" Here my friend the <roleName>emigrant</roleName>, seeing 
my alarm, interposed, and a scene ensued, which, in spite of the horrors of this horrible propinquity, was
irresistibly comic, and not without its pathetic significance too, now I come to think of it. The <trait type="ethnicity"><label>Englishman</label></trait>,
forgetting that the condition of the man placed him for the time beyond the influence of reasoning or sympathy,
began with grave and benevolent earnestness to lecture him on
<pb n="287"/><seg type="pagenumber">283</seg>his profligate habits, expressing his amazement and his pity at seeing such a fine young man fallen into such evil
ways, and exhorting him to mend, the fellow, meanwhile, rolling himself from side to side with laughter. But 
suddenly his countenance changed, and he said with a wistful expression, and the tears in his eyes, "Friend, do 
you believe in the devil?"</p>
         <p>"Yes, I do," replied the <trait type="ethnicity"><label>Englishman</label></trait>, with solemnity.</p>
         <p>"Then it's your opinion, I 
guess, that a man may be tempted by the devil?"</p>
         <p>"Yes, and I should suppose as how that has been your case, friend; 
though," added he, looking at him from head to foot with no equivocal expression, "I think the devil himself might 
have more charity than to put a man in such a pickle."</p>
         <p>"What do you mean by that?" exclaimed the wretch fiercely,
and for the first time uttering a horrid oath. The <roleName>emigrant</roleName> only replied by shaking his head significantly; and
the other, after pouring forth a volley of abuse against the insolence of the "<placeName>old country</placeName> folk," stretched himself
on his back, and kicking up his legs on high, and setting his feet against the roof of the coach, fell asleep in
this attitude, and snored, till, at the end of a long hour, he was tumbled out at the door of another drinking 
hovel as he had tumbled in, and we saw him no more.</p>
         <p>The distance from the town of <placeName>Niagara</placeName> to <placeName>Hamilton</placeName> is about forty 
miles. We had left the former place at ten in the morning, yet it was nearly
<pb n="288"/><seg type="pagenumber">284</seg>midnight before we arrived, having had no refreshment during the whole day. It was market-day, and the time of the 
assizes, and not a bed to be had at the only tolerable hotel, which, I should add, is large and commodious. The 
people were civil beyond measure, and a bed was made up for me in a back parlour, into which I sank half starved,
and very completely tired.</p>
         <p>The next day rose bright and beautiful, and I amused myself walking up and down the 
pretty town for two or three hours.</p>
         <p><placeName>Hamilton</placeName> is the capital of the <placeName>Gore district</placeName>, and one of the most flourishing 
places in <placeName>Upper Canada</placeName>. It is situated at the extreme point of <placeName>Burlington Bay</placeName>, at the head of <placeName>Lake Ontario</placeName>, with a
population, annually increasing, of about three thousand. The town is about a mile from the lake shore, a space 
which, in the course of time, will probably be covered with buildings. I understand that seventeen thousand bushels 
of wheat were shipped here in one month. There is a bank here; a court-house and jail looking unfinished, and the 
commencement of a public reading-room and literary society, of which I cannot speak from my own knowledge, and which
appears as yet in embryo. Some of the <roleName>linen-drapers</roleName>' shops, called here clothing stores, and the grocery stores, 
or shops for all the descriptions of imported merchandise, made a very good appearance; and there was an air of 
business, and bustle, and animation about the place which pleased me. I saw no <roleName>bookseller</roleName>'s shop, but a few books on the
<pb n="289"/><seg type="pagenumber">285</seg>shelves of a grocery store, of the most common and coarse description.</p>
         <p><persName>Allen M'Nab</persName>, the present <roleName>speaker of the house 
of assembly</roleName>, has a very beautiful house here, and is a principal <roleName>merchant</roleName> and <roleName>proprietor</roleName> in the town; but he was 
at this time absent. I had heard much of <persName>Mr. Cattermole</persName>, the <roleName>author</roleName> of a very clever little book addressed to
<roleName>emigrants</roleName>, and also a distinguished <roleName>inhabitant</roleName> of the place. I wished to see this gentleman, but there were 
some difficulties in finding him, and, after waiting some time, I was obliged to take my departure, a long day's 
journey being before me.</p> 
         <p>I hope you have a map of <placeName>Canada</placeName> before you, or at hand, that what I am now going to tell
you may be intelligible.</p>
         <p>They have projected a railroad from <placeName>Hamilton</placeName> westward through the <placeName>London</placeName> and <placeName>Western 
            districts</placeName>—certainly one of the grandest and most useful undertakings in the world—in <hi rend="italics">this</hi> world, I mean. The 
want of a line of road, of an accessible market for agricultural produce, keeps this magnificent country poor and
ignorant in the midst of unequal capabilities. If the formation of the <placeName>Rideau Canal</placeName>, in the eastern districts, 
(connecting <placeName>Lake Ontario</placeName> with the <placeName>Ottawa river</placeName>,) has, in spite of many disadvantages in the soil and locality, 
brought that part of the province so far in advance of the rest, in population, wealth, and intelligence—what 
would not a railroad do for them here, where the need is at least as great—the resources, natural and <hi rend="italics">accidental</hi>,
much superior—and the prospect of
<pb n="290"/><seg type="pagenumber">286</seg>advantage, in every point of view, infinitely more promising?</p>
         <p>Under all disadvantages, this part of the province 
            has been the usual route of <roleName>emigrants</roleName> to the <placeName>Western States of the Union</placeName>; for, as you will perceive by a 
glance at the map, it is the shortest road to <placeName>Michigan</placeName> and the <placeName>Illinois</placeName> by some hundreds of miles. If there were 
but a railroad, opening a direct communication through the principal settlements between <placeName>Hamilton</placeName> on <placeName>Lake Ontario</placeName>,
and <placeName>Sandwich</placeName> at the head of <placeName>Lake Erie</placeName>, there is no calculating the advantages that must arise from it—even 
immediate advantage; but "want of capital," as I hear all round me—and they might add want of energy, want of
enterprise, want of every thing needful, besides money—the one thing most needful—are likely to defer the 
completion of this magnificent plan for many years. I wonder some of our great <roleName>speculators</roleName> and <trait type="ethnicity"><label>monied men in
   <placeName>England</placeName></label></trait> do not speculate here, instead of sending their money to the <placeName>United States</placeName>;—or rather I do <hi rend="italics">not</hi> wonder,
seeing what I see. But I wish that the government would do something to remove the almost universal impression,
that this province is regarded by the powers at home with distrust and indifference—something to produce more
confidence in <roleName>public men</roleName> and public measures, without which there can be no enterprise, no prosperity, no
railroads. What that something is, being no <roleName>politician</roleName> nor <roleName>political economist</roleName> like <persName>Harriet Martineau</persName>, I 
cannot point out, nor even conjecture. I have just sense enough to see, to feel, that something
            <pb n="291"/><seg type="pagenumber">287</seg><hi rend="italics">must</hi> be done—that the necessity speaks in every form all round me.</p>
         <p>I should not forget to mention, that in the
            <placeName>Niagara</placeName> and <placeName>Gore districts</placeName> there is a vast number of <trait type="ethnicity"><label>Dutch</label></trait> and <trait type="ethnicity"><label>German <roleName>settlers</roleName></label></trait>, favorably distinguished by 
their industrious, sober, and thriving habits. They are always to be distinguished in person and dress from the 
            <trait type="ethnicity"><label>British <roleName>settlers</roleName></label></trait>; and their houses, and churches, and above all, their burial-places, have a distinct and 
            characteristic look. At <placeName>Berlin</placeName>, the <trait type="ethnicity"><label>Germans</label></trait> have a printing-press, and publish a newspaper in their own language,
which is circulated among their countrymen through the whole province.</p>
         <p>At <placeName>Hamilton</placeName> I hired a light <hi rend="italics">wagon</hi>, as
they call it, a sort of gig perched in the middle of a wooden tray, wherein my baggage was stowed; and a man to 
drive me over to <placeName>Brandtford</placeName>, the distance being about five-and-twenty miles, and the charge five dollars. The 
country all the way was rich, and beautiful, and fertile beyond description—the roads abominable as could be 
imagined to exist. So I then thought, but have learned since that, there are degrees of badness in this respect,
to which the human imagination has not yet descended. I remember a space of about three miles on this road, 
bordered entirely on each side by dead trees, which has been artificially blasted by fire, or by girdling. It was
a ghastly forest of tall white spectres, strangely contrasting with the glowing luxurious foliage all around.</p>
<p>The pity I have for the trees in <placeName>Canada</placeName>, shows
<pb n="292"/><seg type="pagenumber">288</seg>how far I am yet from being a <trait type="ethnicity"><label>true Canadian</label></trait>. How do we know that trees do not feel their downfal? We know 
nothing about it. The line which divides animal from vegetable sensibility is as undefined as the line which 
divides animal from human intelligence. And if it be true "that nothing dies on earth but nature mourns," how 
must she mourn for these, the mighty children of her bosom—her pride, her glory, her garment? Without exactly
believing the assertion of the old philosopher,* that a tree <hi rend="italics">feels</hi> the first stroke of the axe, I know I never 
witness nor hear that first stroke without a shudder; and as yet I cannot look on with indifference, far
less share the <trait type="ethnicity"><label>Canadian</label></trait>'s exultation, when these huge oaks, these umbrageous elms and stately pines, are lying
prostrate, lopped of all their honors, and piled in heaps with the brushwood, to be fired—or burned down to
a charred and blackened fragment—or standing, leafless, sapless, seared, ghastly, having been "girdled," 
and left to perish. The <q>"Fool i' the Forest,"</q>* moralized not more quaintly over the wounded deer, than I could
sometimes over those prostrated and mangled trees. I remember in one of the clearings to-day, one particular 
tree which had been burned and blasted; only a blackened stump of mouldering bark—a mere shell remained; 
and from the centre of this, as from some hidden source of vitality, sprang up a young green shoot, tall and 
flourishing, and fresh
   <seg type="footnote">Quoted by <persName>Evelyn</persName></seg>
   <seg type="footnote"> As You Like It. </seg>
<pb n="293"/><seg type="pagenumber">289</seg>and leafy. I looked and thought of hope! Why, indeed, should we ever despair? Can Heaven do for the blasted 
tree what it cannot do for the human heart?</p>
         <p>The largest place we passed was <placeName>Ancaster</placeName>, very prettily situated 
among pastures and rich woods, and rapidly improving.</p>
         <p>Before sunset I arrived at <placeName>Brandtford</placeName>, and took a walk 
about the town and its environs. The situation of this place is most beautiful—on a hill above the left bank
of the <placeName>Grand River</placeName>. And as I stood and traced this noble stream winding through richly-wooded flats, with 
green meadows and cultivated fields, I was involuntarily reminded of the <placeName>Thames</placeName> near <placeName>Richmond</placeName>; the scenery 
has the same character of tranquil and luxuriant beauty.</p>
         <p>In <placeName>Canada</placeName> the <roleName>traveller</roleName> can enjoy little of the
interest derived from association, either historical or poetical. Yet the memory of <persName>General Brock</persName>, and some
anecdotes of the last war, lend something of this kind of interest to the <placeName>Niagara</placeName> frontier; and this place,
or rather the name of this place, has certain recollections connected with it, which might well make an 
idle contemplative wayfarer a little pensive.</p>
         <p><persName>Brandt</persName> was the <roleName>chief</roleName> of that band of <trait type="ethnicity"><label>Mohawk <roleName>warriors</roleName></label></trait> which 
            served on the <trait type="ethnicity"><label>British side</label></trait> during the <trait type="ethnicity"><label>American War of Independence</label></trait>. After the termination of the contest, 
            the "<trait type="ethnicity"><label>Six Nations</label></trait>" left their ancient seats to the south of <placeName>Lake Ontario</placeName>, and having received from the 
            <trait type="ethnicity"><label>English government</label></trait> a grant of land along the banks of the <placeName>Grand River</placeName>, <seg type="pagesignature">vol. IV. 25</seg>
<pb n="294"/><seg type="pagenumber">290</seg>and the adjacent shore of <placeName>Lake Erie</placeName>, they settled here under their <roleName>chief</roleName>, <persName>Brandt</persName>, in <date>1783</date>.
Great part of this land, some of the finest in the province, has lately been purchased back from them by the 
government, and settled by thriving <trait type="ethnicity"><label>English farmers</label></trait>.</p>
         <p><persName>Brandt</persName>, who had intelligence enough to perceive and 
            acknowledge the superiority of the <trait type="race"><label>whites</label></trait> in all the arts of life, was at first anxious for the conversion
and civilization of his nation; but I was told by a gentleman who had known him, that after a visit he paid
to <placeName>England</placeName>, this wish no longer existed. He returned to his own people with no very sublime idea either of 
our morals or manners, and died in <date>1807</date>.</p>
         <p>He is the <persName>Brandt</persName> whom <persName>Campbell</persName> has handed down to most undeserved 
execration as the leader in the massacre at <placeName>Wyoming</placeName>. The <roleName>poet</roleName> indeed tells us, in the notes to <persName>Gertrude</persName> of
<placeName>Wyoming</placeName>, that all he has said against <persName>Brandt</persName> must be considered as pure fiction, "for that he was 
remarkable for his humanity, and not even present at the massacre;" but the name stands in the text as 
heretofore, apostrophized as the "accursed <persName>Brandt</persName>," the "monster <persName>Brandt</persName>;" and is not this most unfair, 
to be hitched into elegant and popular rhyme as an assassin by wholesale, and justice done in a little fag-end of prose?</p>
         <p>His son, <persName>John Brandt</persName>, received a good education, and was a member of the <orgName>house of assembly</orgName> for his
district. He too died in a short time before my arrival in this country; and the son of his sister,
            <pb n="295"/><seg type="pagenumber">291</seg><persName>Mrs. Kerr</persName>, is at present the hereditary <roleName>chief</roleName> of the <trait type="ethnicity"><label>Six Nations</label></trait>.</p>
         <p>They consist at present of two thousand 
five hundred, out of the seven or eight thousand who first settled here. Here, as every where else, the decrease
of the <trait type="race"><label>Indian population</label></trait> settled on the reserve lands is uniform. The <trait type="race"><label>white population</label></trait> throughout <placeName>America</placeName> is 
            supposed to double itself on an average in twenty-three years; in about the same proportion do the <trait type="race"><label>Indians</label></trait>
perish before them.</p>
         <p>The interests and property of these <trait type="race"><label>Indians</label></trait> are at present managed by the government. The 
revenue arising from the sale of their lands is in the hands of <roleName>commissioners</roleName>, and much is done for their 
            conversion and civilization. It will, however, be the affair of two, or three, or more generations; and by that time not
many, I am afraid, will be left. Consumption makes dreadful havoc among them. At present they have churches, 
schools, and an able <roleName>missionary</roleName> who has studied their language, beside several resident <trait type="religion"><label>Methodist <roleName>preachers</roleName></label></trait>. Of 
the two thousand five hundred already mentioned, the far greater part retain their old faith and customs, having 
borrowed from the <trait type="race"><label>whites</label></trait>, only those habits which certainly <q>"were more honored in the breach than in the 
observance."</q> I saw many of these people, and spoke to some, who replied with a quiet, self-possessed courtesy, 
            and in very <trait type="ethnicity"><label>intelligible English</label></trait>. One group which I met outside the town, consisting of two young men in blanket 
coats and leggings, one haggard old woman, with a man's hat on her head, a blue blanket and deer-skin moccasins, and a
<pb n="296"/><seg type="pagenumber">292</seg>very beautiful girl, apparently not more than fifteen, similarly dressed, with long black hair hanging loose over
her face and shoulders, and a little baby, many shades fairer than herself, peeping from the folds of her blanket
behind, altogether reminded me of a group of <trait type="ethnicity"><label>gipsies</label></trait>, such as I have seen on the borders of <placeName>Sherwood Forest</placeName> many 
years ago.</p>
         <p>The <placeName>Grand River</placeName> is navigable for steam-boats from <placeName>Lake Erie</placeName> up to the landing-place, about two miles 
below <placeName>Brandtford</placeName>, and from thence a canal is to be cut, some time or other, to the town. The present site of 
<placeName>Brandtford</placeName> was chosen on account of those very rapids which do indeed obstruct the navigation, but turn a number
            of mills, here of the first importance. The usual progress of a <trait type="ethnicity"><label>Canadian village</label></trait> is this: first on some running 
stream, the erection of a saw-mill and grist-mill for the convenience of the neighboring scattered <roleName>settlers</roleName>; 
then a few shanties or log-houses for the <roleName>work-people</roleName>; then a grocery-store; then a tavern—a chapel—perchance
            a school-house—<hi rend="italics">und so weiter</hi>, as the <trait type="ethnicity"><label>Germans</label></trait> say.*</p>
         <p><seg type="footnote">The erection of a church or chapel generally precedes that of a school-house in <placeName>Upper Canada,</placeName>
            but the mill and the tavern invariably precede both. "In the <placeName>United States,"</placeName> says <persName>Mr. Schoolcraft,</persName>
            "the first public edifice is a court-house; then a jail; then a school-house—perhaps an academy,
            where religious exercises may be occasionally held; but a house of public worship is the result of a 
            more mature state of the settlement. If," he adds, "we have sometimes been branded as litigious, it is 
            not altogether without foundation; and, notwithstanding the very humble estimate which foreign reviewers have
            been pleased to make of our literary character and attainments, there is more likelihood of our obtaining the 
            reputation of a learned than a pious people."—Schoolcraft's Travels.</seg></p> 
<pb n="297"/><p><seg type="pagenumber">293</seg></p><p>Not having been properly forewarned, I unfortutunalely allowed the <roleName>driver</roleName> to take me to a wrong inn. I ought to 
   have put up at the <placeName>Mansion-house</placeName>, well-kept by a retired half-pay <trait type="ethnicity"><label>British officer</label></trait>; instead of which I was 
   brought to the <placeName>Commercial Hotel</placeName>, newly undertaken by an <trait type="ethnicity"><label>American</label></trait>. I sent to the landlord to say I wished to speak
to him about proceeding on my journey next day. The next moment the man walked into my bed-room without hesitation
or apology. I was too much accustomed to <trait type="ethnicity"><label>foreign manners</label></trait> to be greatly discomfited; but when he proceeded to
fling his hat down on my bed, and throw himself into the only armchair in the room, while I was standing, I must
own I did look at him with some surprise. To those who have been accustomed to the servile courtesy of <trait type="ethnicity"><label>English 
   <roleName>innkeepers</roleName></label></trait>, the manners of the <roleName>innkeepers</roleName> in the <placeName>United States</placeName> are not pleasant. I cannot say they ever discomposed
me: I always met with civility and attention; but the manners of the <roleName>country innkeepers</roleName> in <placeName>Canada</placeName> are worse 
   than any thing you can meet with in the <placeName>United States</placeName>, being generally kept by <trait type="ethnicity"><label>refugee Americans</label></trait> of the lowest 
   class, or by <trait type="ethnicity"><label>Canadians</label></trait> who, in affecting <trait type="ethnicity"><label>American manners and phraseology</label></trait>, grossly exaggerate both.</p>
         <p>In the present 
case I saw at once that no incivility was intended; my <roleName>landlord</roleName> was ready at a fair price to drive me over
himself, in his own "wagon," to <placeName>Woodstock</placeName>; and after this was settled, finding, after a few questions, that
the man was really a most
<pb n="298"/><seg type="pagenumber">294</seg>stupid, ignorant fellow, I turned to the window, and took up a book, as a hint for him to be gone. He continued,
            however, to lounge in the chair, rocking himself in silence to and fro, till at last he <hi rend="italics">did</hi> condescend to take 
my hint, and to take his departure. Though tired beyond expression, I was for some time prevented from going to 
rest by one of those disgraceful scenes which meet me at every turn. A man in the dress of a gentleman, but in a 
state of brutal intoxication, was staggering, swearing, vociferating, beneath my window, while a party of men, 
also respectably dressed, who were smoking and drinking before the door, regarded him with amusement or indifference;
<roleName type="family">some children</roleName> and a few <trait type="race"><label>Indians</label></trait> were looking on. This person, as the <roleName>maidservant</roleName> informed me, was by birth a 
gentleman, and had good practice in the law. "Three years ago there wasn't a smarter (cleverer) man in the district:"
now he was ruined utterly in health, fortune, and character. His wife's relations had taken her and her 
<roleName type="family">children</roleName> away, and had since clothed him, and allowed him something for a subsistence. He continued to disturb
the whole neighborhood for two hours, and I was really surprised by the forbearance with which he was treated.</p>
<p>Next morning I took another walk. There are several good shops and many houses in progress, some of them of 
brick and stone. I met two or three well-dressed women walking down <placeName>Colborne street</placeName>; and the people were bustling
   about with animated faces—a strong contrast to the <trait type="race"><label>melancholy, indolent-looking Indians</label></trait>. I understand that there
<pb n="299"/><seg type="pagenumber">295</seg>are now about twelve hundred <roleName>inhabitants</roleName>, the population having tripled in three years: and they have a 
   newspaper, an agricultural society, a post-office; a Congregational, a <trait type="religion"><label>Baptist</label></trait>, and <trait type="religion"><label>Methodist church</label></trait>, a large
chair manufactory, and other mills and manufactories which I had no time to visit.</p><!-- Horizontal line -->
<p>At ten o'clock, a little vehicle, like that which brought me from <placeName>Hamilton</placeName>, was at the door; and I set off for 
   <placeName>Woodstock</placeName>, driven by my <trait type="ethnicity"><label>American <roleName>landlord</roleName></label></trait>, who showed himself as good-natured and civil as he was impenetrably 
stupid.</p>
         <p>No one who has a single atom of imagination, can travel through these forest roads of <placeName>Canada</placeName> without being
strongly impressed and excited. The seemingly interminable line of trees before you; the boundless wilderness 
around; the mysterious depths amid the multitudinous foliage, where foot of man hath never penetrated,—and which
partial gleams of the noontide sun, now seen, now lost, lit up with a changeful, magical beauty—the wondrous 
splendor and novelty of the flowers—the silence, unbroken but by the low cry of a bird, or hum of insect, or 
the splash and croak of some huge bullfrog,—the solitude in which we proceeded mile after mile, no human being,
no human dwelling within sight,—are all either exciting to the fancy, or oppressive to the spirits, according to 
the mood one may be in. Their effect on myself I can hardly describe in words.</p>
<pb n="300"/><p><seg type="pagenumber">296</seg></p><p>*****</p> <p>I observed some birds of a species new to me; there was the lovely blue-bird, with its brilliant violet 
plumage; and a most gorgeous species of woodpecker, with a black head, white breast, and back and wings of the 
brightest scarlet; hence it is called by some the <roleName>field-officer</roleName>, and more generally the cock of the woods. I 
should have called it the coxcomb of the woods, for it came flitting across our road, clinging to the trees 
before us, and remaining pertinaciously in sight, as if conscious of its own splendid array, and pleased to be 
admired.</p>
         <p>There was also the <trait type="ethnicity"><label>Canadian robin</label></trait>, a bird as large as a thrush, but in plumage and shape resembling the
sweet bird at home <q>"that wears the scarlet stomacher."</q> There were great numbers of small birds of a bright 
yellow, like canaries, and I believe of the same genus. Sometimes, when I looked up from the depth of foliage to
the blue firmament above, I saw the eagle sailing through the air on apparently motionless wings. Nor let me forget
the splendor of the flowers which carpeted the woods on either side. I might have exclaimed with Eichendorff,
<lg><l>"О Welt! Du schöne welt, Du! </l>
<l>Mann sieht Dich vor Blumen kaum!</l></lg>
for thus in some places did a rich embroidered
pall of flowers literally <hi rend="italics">hide</hi> the earth. There those beautiful plants, which we cultivate with such care in our
gardens, azalias, rhododendrons, all the gorgeous family of the lobelia, were flourishing in
<pb n="301"/><seg type="pagenumber">297</seg>wild luxuriance. Festoons of creeping and parasitical plants hung from branch to branch. The purple and scarlet
            iris, blue larkspur, and the elegant <trait type="ethnicity"><label>Canadian columbine</label></trait> with its bright pink flowers; the scarlet lychnis, 
a species of orchis of the most dazzling geranium-color, and the white and yellow and purple cyprepedium,* bordered 
the path, and a thousand others of most resplendent hues, for which I knew no names. I could not pass them with 
forbearance, and my <trait type="ethnicity"><label>Yankee driver</label></trait>, alighting, gathered for me a superb bouquet from the swampy margin of the forest. 
I contrived to fasten my flowers in a wreath along the front of the wagon, that I might enjoy at leisure their
novelty and beauty. How lavish, how carelessly profuse is nature in her handiwork! In the interior of the cyprepedium,
which I tore open, there was variety of configuration, and color, and gem-like richness of ornament, enough to

            kept by a <trait type="ethnicity"><label>Frenchman</label></trait>, I dined on milk and eggs and excellent bread. Here I found every appearance of prosperity 
            and plenty. The <roleName>landlady</roleName>, an <trait type="ethnicity"><label>American woman</label></trait>, told me they had come into this wilderness twenty years ago, when 
there was not another farm-house within fifty miles. She had brought up and settled in comfort several <roleName type="family">sons and 
daughters.</roleName> An <trait type="ethnicity"><label>Irish farmer</label></trait> came in, who had refreshments spread for him in the porch, and with whom I had some 
amusing conversation. He, too, was prospering with a large farm and a large family,—here a blessing and a means
of wealth, too often in the <placeName>old country</placeName> a curse and a burthen. The good-natured fellow was extremely scandalized 
by my homely and temperate fare, which he besought me to mend by accepting a glass of whiskey out of his own 
travelling-store, genuine potheen, which he swore deeply, and not unpoetically, "had never seen God's beautiful 
world, nor the blessed light of day, since it had been bottled in ould <placeName>Ireland</placeName>." He told me, boastingly, that at 
<placeName>Hamilton</placeName> he had made eight hundred dollars by the present extraordinary rise in the price of wheat. In the early
part of the year, wheat had been selling for three or four dollars a bushel, and rose this summer to twelve and 
fourteen dollars a bushel, owing to the immense quantities exported during the winter to the back settlements
of <placeName>Michigan</placeName> and the <placeName>Illinois</placeName>.</p>
         <p>The whole drive would have been productive of unmixed enjoyment, but for 
one almost intolerable
<pb n="303"/><seg type="pagenumber">299</seg>draw-back. The roads were throughout so execrably bad, that no words can give you an idea of them. We often 
sank into mud-holes above the axletree; then over trunks of trees laid across swamps, called here corduroy roads,
were my poor bones dislocated. A wheel here and there, or broken shaft lying by the way-side, told of former 
wrecks and disasters. In some places they had, in desperation, flung huge boughs of oak into the mud abyss, 
and covered them with clay and sod, the rich green foliage projecting on either side. This sort of illusive 
contrivance would sometimes give way, and we were nearly precipitated in the midst. By the time we arrived at 
<placeName>Biandford</placeName>, my hands were swelled and blistered by continually grasping with all my strength an iron bar in front
of my vehicle, to prevent myself from being flung out, and my limbs ached wofully. I never beheld or imagined
such roads. It is clear that the people do not apply any, even the commonest, principles of road-making; no 
drains are cut, no attempt is made at levelling or preparing a foundation. The <roleName>settlers</roleName> around are too much
engrossed by the necessary toil for a daily subsistence to give a moment of their time to road-making, without
compulsion or good payment. The <roleName>statute labor</roleName> does not appear to be duly enforced by the <roleName>commissioners</roleName> and 
<roleName>magistrates</roleName>, and there are no <roleName>laborers</roleName>, and no spare money; specie, never very plentiful in these parts, is 
            not to be had at present, and the 500,000<hi rend="italics">l</hi>., voted during the last session of the <orgName>provincial parliament</orgName> for the
repair of roads, is not yet even raised, I believe.</p>
<pb n="304"/><p><seg type="pagenumber">300</seg></p><p>Nor is this all: the vile state of the roads, the very little communication between places not far distant from
each other, leave it in the power of ill-disposed persons to sow mischief among the ignorant, isolated people.</p>
<p>On emerging from a forest road seven miles in length, we stopped at a little inn to refresh the poor jaded horses.
Several <roleName>laborers</roleName> were lounging about the door, and I spoke to them of the horrible state of the roads. They agreed,
one and all, that it was entirely the fault of the government; that their welfare was not eared for; that it was
true that money had been voted for the roads, but that before any thing could be done, or a shilling of it 
expended, it was always necessary to write to the <placeName>old country</placeName> to ask the <roleName>king</roleName>'s permission—which might be sent
or not—who could tell! And meantime they were ruined for want of roads, which it was nobody's business to 
reclaim.</p>
         <p>It was in vain that I attempted to point out to the <roleName>orator</roleName> of the party the falsehood and absurdity of
this notion. He only shook his head, and said he knew better.</p> 
         <p>One man observed, that as the team of <persName>Admiral 
V------</persName>(one of the largest <roleName>proprietors</roleName> in the district) had lately broken down in a mud-hole, there was some 
hope that the roads about here might be looked to.</p>
         <p>About sunset, I arrived at <placeName>Biandford</placeName>, dreadfully weary, and 
fevered, and bruised, having been more than nine hours travelling twenty-five miles; and I must needs own that
not all my <hi rend="italics">savoir faire</hi> could
<pb n="305"/><seg type="pagenumber">301</seg>prevent me from feeling rather dejected and shy, as I drove up to the residence of a gentleman, to whom, indeed,
I had not a letter, but whose family, as I had been assured, were prepared to receive me. It was rather formidable
to arrive thus, at fall of night, a wayfaring, lonely woman, spiritless, half-dead with fatigue, among entire 
strangers: but my reception set me at ease in a moment. The words, "We have been long expecting you!" uttered
in a kind, cordial voice, sounded <q>"like sweetest music to attending ears."</q> A handsome, elegant-looking woman, 
            blending <trait type="ethnicity"><label>French ease and politeness</label></trait> with <trait type="ethnicity"><label>English cordiality</label></trait>, and a whole <roleName type="family">brood of lively children of all sizes 
and ages,</roleName> stood beneath the porch to welcome me with smiles and outstretched hands. Can you imagine my bliss, 
my gratitude?—no!—impossible, unless you had travelled for three days through the wilds of <placeName>Canada</placeName>. In a few
hours I felt quite at home, and my day of rest was insensibly prolonged to a week, spent with this amiable and 
interesting family—a week, ever while I live, to be remembered with pleasurable and grateful feelings.</p><!-- Horizontal line -->
<p>The region of <placeName>Canada</placeName> in which I now find myself, is called the <placeName>London District</placeName>; you will see its situation at 
once by a glance on the map. It lies between the <placeName>Gore District</placeName> and the <placeName>Western District</placeName>, having to the south a large 
   extent of the coast of <placeName>Lake Erie</placeName>; and on the north the <trait type="race"><label>Indian territories</label></trait>, and part of the southern shore of <placeName>Lake 
      Huron</placeName>. It <seg type="pagesignature">vol. I. 26</seg>
<pb n="306"/><seg type="pagenumber">302</seg>is watered by rivers flowing into both lakes, but chiefly by the river <placeName>Thames</placeName>, which is here (about one hundred miles
   from its mouth) a small but most beautiful stream, winding like the <placeName>Isis</placeName>, at <placeName>Oxford</placeName>. <placeName>Woodstock</placeName>, the nearest <hi rend="italics">village</hi>, 
as I suppose I must in modesty call it, is fast rising into an important town, and the whole district is, for its
scenery, fertility, and advantages of every kind, perhaps the finest in <placeName>Upper Canada</placeName>.*</p>
         <p>The society in this immediate neighborhood is particularly good; several gentlemen of family, superior education, and large capital,
            (among whom is the brother of an <trait type="ethnicity"><label>English</label></trait> and the son of an <trait type="ethnicity"><label>Irish peer</label></trait>, a <roleName>colonel</roleName> and a <roleName>major</roleName> in the army,) have made
very extensive purchases of land, and their estates are in flourishing progress.</p>
         <p>One day we drove over to the 
settlement of one of these magnificos, <persName>Admiral V------</persName>, who has already expended upwards of twenty thousand pounds
            in purchases and improvements. His house is really a curiosity, and at the first glance reminded me of an <trait type="ethnicity"><label>African 
village</label></trait>—a sort of <placeName>Timbuctoo</placeName> set down in the woods; it is two or three miles from the high road, in the midst of the
forest, and looked as if a number of log-huts had jostled against each other by accident, and there stuck fast.</p>
         <p>The <roleName>admiral</roleName> had begun, I imagine, by erecting, as is usual, a log-house, while the woods were clearing; then, being
in want of space, he added
<seg type="footnote">The average produce of an acre of land is greater throughout
<placeName>Canada</placeName> than in <placeName>England.</placeName> In these western districts greater than in the rest of <placeName>Canada.</placeName></seg>
<pb n="307"/><seg type="pagenumber">303</seg>another, then another and another, and so on, all of different shapes and sizes, and full of a <roleName>seaman</roleName>'s contrivances—
odd galleries, passages, porticos, corridors, saloons, cabins and cupboards; so that if the outside reminded me 
of an <trait type="ethnicity"><label>African village</label></trait>, the interior was no less like that of a man-of-war.</p>
         <p>The drawing-room, which occupies an 
entire building, is really a noble room, with a chimney in which they pile twenty oak logs at once. Around this
room runs a gallery, well lighted with windows from without, through which there is a constant circulation of 
air, keeping the room warm in winter and cool in summer. The <roleName>admiral</roleName> has besides so many ingenious and inexplicable 
contrivances for warming and airing his house, that no insurance office will insure him upon any terms. Altogether
it was the most strangely picturesque sort of dwelling I ever beheld, and could boast not only of luxuries and comforts, 
such as are seldom found so far inland, but "cosa altra più <hi rend="italics">cara</hi>," or at least " più <hi rend="italics">rara</hi>." The <roleName>admiral</roleName>'s sister,
an accomplished woman of independent fortune, has lately arrived from <placeName>Europe</placeName>, to take up her residence in the
wilds. Having recently spent some years in <placeName>Italy</placeName>, she has brought out with her all those pretty objects of virtù,
            with which <trait type="ethnicity"><label>English travellers</label></trait> load themselves in that country. Here, ranged round the room, I found views of <placeName>Rome</placeName>
and <placeName>Naples</placeName>; tazzi, and marbles, and sculpture in lava, or alabaster; miniature copies of the eternal Sibyl and 
Cenci, <persName>Raffaelle</persName>'s <placeName>Vatican</placeName>, &amp;c.—things not wonderful nor rare in themselves—the wonder was too see them here.</p>
<pb n="308"/><p><seg type="pagenumber">304</seg></p><p>The woods are yet close up to the house; but there is a fine well-cultivated garden, and the process of clearing 
and log-burning proceeds all around with great animation.</p>
         <p>The good <roleName>admiral</roleName>, who is no longer young—<hi rend="italics">au contraire</hi> 
            —has recently astonished the whole neighborhood—nay, the whole province, by taking to himself a young, <roleName type="family">very 
young wife,</roleName> of a station very inferior to his own. There have been considerable doubts in the neighborhood as to 
the propriety of visiting the young lady—doubts which appear to me neither reasonable nor good-natured, and which 
will, no doubt, give way before the common sense and kind feeling of the people. Selden might well say, that of all
the actions of a man's life, his marriage was that in which others had the least concern, and were sure to meddle
the most! If this gentleman be unhappy, he has committed a folly, and will be punished for it sufficiently 
without the interference of his friends and neighbors. If he be happy, and they say he is, then he has committed 
no folly, and may laugh at them all round. His good sister has come out to countenance him and his ménage—a
proof equally of her affection and her understanding. I can now only wish her a continuance of the same cheerfulness,
fortitude and perseverance she has hitherto shown—virtues very necessary in this new province.</p>
         <p>On Sunday, we attended the pretty little church at <placeName>Woodstock</placeName>, which was filled by the neighboring <roleName>settlers</roleName> of all classes: 
the service was well read, and the hymns were sung by the ladies of the
<pb n="309"/><seg type="pagenumber">305</seg><orgName>congregation</orgName>. The sermon, which treated of some abstract and speculative point of theology, seemed to me not well
adapted to the sort of <orgName>congregation</orgName> assembled. The situation of those who had here met together to seek a new 
existence in a new world, might have afforded topics of instruction, praise, and gratitude, far more practical,
more congenial, more intelligible than a mere controversial essay on a disputed text, which elicited no remark 
nor sympathy that I could perceive. After the service, the <orgName>congregation</orgName> remained some time assembled before the
church-door, in various and interesting groups—the well-dressed families of <roleName>settlers</roleName> who had come from many miles'
distance, in vehicles well-suited to the roads—that is to say, carts, or, as they call them here, teams or wagons;
the belles and the beaux of "the Bush," in Sunday trim—and innumerable <roleName type="family">children.</roleName> Many were the greetings and 
inquiries; the news and gossip of all the neighborhood had to be exchanged. The conversation among the ladies 
was of marriages and births—lamentations on the want of <roleName>servants</roleName> and the state of the roads—the last arrival of
letters from <placeName>England</placeName>—and speculations upon the character of a new neighbor come to settle in the Bush: Among 
the gentlemen, it was of crops and clearings, lumber, price of wheat, road-mending, deer-shooting, log-burning, 
and so forth—subjects in which I felt a lively interest and curiosity; and if I could not take a very brilliant
and prominent part in the discourse, I could at least listen, like the <trait type="ethnicity"><label>Irish</label></trait> corn-field, <q>"with all my ears."</q></p>
         <p>I think it was this day at dinner that a gentleman <seg type="pagesignature">26*</seg>
            <pb n="310"/><seg type="pagenumber">306</seg>described to me a family of <trait type="ethnicity"><label>Mohawk Indians</label></trait>, consisting of seven individuals, who had encamped upon some of his 
uncleared land in two wigwams. They had made their first appearance in the early spring, and had since subsisted 
by bunting, selling their venison for whiskey or tobacco; their appearance and situation were, he said, most 
wretched, and their indolence extreme. Within three months, five out of the seven were dead of consumption; two
only were left—languid, squalid, helpless, hopeless, heartless.</p>
<pb n="311"/><p><seg type="pagenumber">307</seg></p><p>After several pleasant and interesting visits to the neighboring <roleName>settlers</roleName>, I took leave of my hospitable friends 
at <placeName>Biandford</placeName> with deep and real regret; and, in the best and only vehicle which could be procured—videlicet, 
a <roleName>baker</roleName>'s cart—set out for <placeName>London</placeName>, the chief town of the district; the distance being about thirty miles—a 
long day's journey; the cost seven dollars.</p>
         <p>The man who drove me proved a very intelligent and <trait type="race"><label>civilized</label></trait> person.
He had come out to <placeName>Canada</placeName> in the capacity of a <roleName>gentleman's servant</roleName>; he now owned some land—I forget how many 
acres—and was besides <roleName>baker-general</roleName> for a large neighborhood, rarely receiving money in pay, but wheat and other
farm produce. He had served as <roleName>constable</roleName> of the district for two years, and gave me some interesting accounts of 
his <roleName>thief</roleName>-taking expeditions through the wild forests in the deep winter nights. He considered himself, on the 
whole, a prosperous man. He said he should be quite happy here, were it not for his <roleName type="family">wife,</roleName> who fretted and pined 
continually after her "home."</p>
         <p>"But," said I, " surely wherever you are, is her home, and she ought to be happy
where she sees you getting on better, and enjoying more of comfort and independence, than you could have hoped to
obtain in the <placeName>old country</placeName>."</p>
         <p>"Well, yes," said he, hesitatingly; "and I can't
            <pb n="312"/><seg type="pagenumber">308</seg>say but that my <roleName type="family">wife</roleName> is a good woman: I've no particular fault to find with her; and it's very natural she 
should mope, for she has no friend or acquaintance, you see, and she doesn't take to the people, and the ways here;
and at home she had <roleName type="family">her mother and her sister</roleName> to talk to; they lived with us, you see. Then, I'm out all day long, 
looking after my business, and she feels quite lonely like, and she's a crying when I come back—and I'm sure I
don't know what to do!"</p>
         <p>The case of this poor fellow with his dicontented <roleName type="family">wife</roleName> is of no unfrequent occurrence in <placeName>Canada</placeName>;
and among the better class of <roleName>settlers</roleName> the matter is worse still, the suffering more acute, and of graver consequences.</p>
<p>I have not often in my life met with contented and cheerful-minded women, but I never met with so many repining and 
   discontented women as in <placeName>Canada</placeName>. I never met with <hi rend="italics">one</hi> woman recently settled here, who considered herself happy in her 
   new home and country: I <hi rend="italics">heard</hi> of one, and doubtless there are others, but they are exceptions to the general rule. 
Those born here, or brought here early by their parents and relations, seemed to me very happy, and many of them had 
adopted a sort of pride in their new country, which I liked much. There was always a great desire to visit <placeName>England</placeName>, 
and some little airs of self-complacency and superiority in those who had been there, though for a few months only; but
all, without a single exception, returned with pleasure, unable to forego the early habitual influences of their 
native land.</p>
         <pb n="313"/><p><seg type="pagenumber">309</seg></p><p>I like patriotism and nationality in women. Among the <trait type="ethnicity"><label>German women</label></trait> both these feelings give a strong tincture to the 
character; and, seldom disunited, they blend with peculiar grace in our sex: but with a great <roleName>statesman</roleName> they should
stand well distinguished. Nationality is not always patriotism, and patriotism is not, necessarily, nationality. The 
            <trait type="ethnicity"><label>English</label></trait> are more patriotic than national; the <trait type="ethnicity"><label>Americans</label></trait> generally more national than patriotic; the <trait type="ethnicity"><label>Germans</label></trait> both 
national and patriotic.</p>
         <p>I have observed that really accomplished women, accustomed to what is called the best society,
have more resources here, and manage better, than some women who have no pretensions of any kind, and whose claims to
social distinction could not have been great any where, but whom I found lamenting over themselves as if they had been 
so many <roleName>exiled princesses</roleName>.</p>
         <p>Can you imagine the position of a fretful, frivolous woman, strong neither in mind nor
frame, abandoned to her own resources in the wilds of <placeName>Upper Canada</placeName>? I do not believe you can imagine any thing so 
            pitiable, so ridiculous, and, to borrow the <trait type="ethnicity"><label>Canadian word</label></trait>, "so shiftless."</p>
         <p>My new friend and kind <roleName>hostess</roleName> was a 
being of quite a different stamp; and though I believe she was far from thinking that she had found in <placeName>Canada</placeName> a 
terrestrial paradise, and the want of <roleName>servants</roleName> and the difficulty of educating her family as she wished, were 
subjects of great annoyance to her, yet these and other evils she had met with a cheerful spirit. Here, amid these
forest wilds, she had recently
<pb n="314"/><seg type="pagenumber">310</seg>given birth to a lovely baby, the tenth, or indeed I believe the twelfth of a flock of manly boys and blooming girls.
Her <roleName type="family">eldest daughter</roleName> mean time, a fair and elegant girl, was acquiring, at the age of fifteen, qualities and habits 
which might well make ample amends for the possessing of mere accomplishments. She acted as a <roleName>manager in chief</roleName>, 
and glided about in her household avocations with a serene and quiet grace which was quite charming.</p>
         <p>The road, after leaving <placeName>Woodstock</placeName>, pursued the course of the winding <placeName>Thames</placeName>. We passed by the house of <persName>Colonel Light</persName>, in 
asituation of superlative natural beauty on a rising-ground above the river. A lawn, tolerably cleared, sloped 
down to the margin, while the opposite shore rose clothed in varied woods which had been managed with great 
taste, and a feeling for the picturesque not common here; but the <roleName>Colonel</roleName> being himself an accomplished <roleName>artist</roleName> 
accounts for this. We also passed <placeName>Beechville</placeName> a small, but beautiful village, round which the soil is reckoned very 
fine and fertile; a number of most respectable <roleName>settlers</roleName> have recently bought land and erected houses here. 
The next place we came to was <placeName>Oxford</placeName>, or rather, <placeName>Ingersol</placeName>, where we stopped to dine and rest previous to plunging 
into an extensive forest, called the <placeName>Pine Woods</placeName>.</p>
         <p><placeName>Oxford</placeName> is a little village, presenting the usual saw-mill, 
grocery-store and tavern, with a dozen shanties congregated on the bank of the stream, which is here rapid and 
confined by high banks. Two <roleName>back-woodsmen</roleName> were in deep consultation over a wagon which had broken down in the midst of
<pb n="315"/><seg type="pagenumber">311</seg>that very forest road we were about to traverse, and which they described as most execrable—in some parts even 
dangerous. As it was necessary to gird up my strength for the undertaking, I laid in a good dinner, consisting of 
slices of dried venison, broiled; hot cakes of <trait type="race"><label>Indian corn</label></trait>, eggs, butter, and a bowl of milk. Of this good fare
I partook in company with the two <roleName>back-woodsmen</roleName>, who appeared to me perfect specimens of their class—tall and 
strong, and bronzed and brawny, and shaggy and unshaven—very much like two bears set on their hind legs; rude 
but not uncivil, and spare of speech, as men who had lived long at a distance from their kind. They were too busy,
however, and so was I, to feel or express any mutual curiosity; time was valuable, appetite urgent—so we 
discussed our venison steaks in silence, and after dinner I proceeded.</p>
         <p>The forest land through which I had 
            lately passed, was principally covered with <hi rend="italics">hard timber</hi>, as oak, walnut, elm, basswood. We were now in a 
forest of pines, rising tall and dark, and monotonous on either side. The road worse certainly <q>"than fancy
ever feigned or fear conceived,"</q> put my neck in perpetual jeopardy. The <roleName>driver</roleName> had often to dismount, and
partly fill up some tremendous hole with boughs before we could pass—or drag or lift the wagon over trunks 
of trees—or we sometimes sank into abysses, from which it is a wonder to me that we ever emerged. A natural
question were—why did you not get out and walk?—Yes indeed! I only wish it had been possible. Immediately
<pb n="316"/><seg type="pagenumber">312</seg>on the border of the road so called, was the wild, tangled, untrodden thicket, as impervious to the foot as the
road was impassable, rich with vegetation, variegated verdure, and flowers of loveliest dye, but the haunt of the
rattlesnake, and all manner of creeping and living things not pleasant to encounter, or even to think of.</p>
         <p>The mosquitos, too, began to be troublesome; but not being yet in full force, I contrived to defend myself pretty well,
by waving a green branch before me whenever my two hands were not employed in forcible endeavors to keep my seat.
These seven miles of pine forests we traversed in three hours and a half; and then succeeded some miles of open flat
country, called <placeName>the oak plains</placeName>, and so called because covered with thickets and groups of oak, dispersed with a 
park-like and beautiful effect; and still flowers, flowers everywhere. The soil appeared sandy, and not so rich as 
in other parts.* The road was comparatively good, and as we approached <placeName>London</placeName>, clearing new settlements appeared on
every side.</p>
         <p>The sun had set amid a tumultuous mass of lurid threatening clouds, and a tempest was brooding in the air,
when I reached the town, and found very tolerable accommodations in the principal inn. I
<seg type="footnote">It is not the most open land which is most desirable for a <roleName>settler.</roleName> 
   "The land," says <persName>Dr. Dunlop</persName> in his admirable little book, "is rich and lasting, just in

   he is put to it in clearing his land, the better will it repay him the labor he has expended on it."</seg>
<pb n="317"/><seg type="pagenumber">313</seg>was so terribly bruised and beaten with fatigue, that to move was impossible, and even to speak, too great an effort.
I cast my weary aching limbs upon the bed, and requested of the very civil and obliging young lady who attended to 
bring me some books and newspapers. She brought me thereupon an old compendium of geography, published at <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> 
<date when="1797">forty years ago</date>, and three newspapers. Two of these, the <placeName>London</placeName> Gazette and the Freeman's Journal, are printed and
published within the district; the third, the <placeName>New-York</placeName> Albion, I have already mentioned to you as having been my 
delight and consolation at <placeName>Toronto</placeName>. This paper, an extensive double folio, is compiled for the use of the

            interesting public news in extracts from the leading <trait type="ethnicity"><label>English journals</label></trait>, with tales, essays, reviews, &amp;c., from 
the periodicals. Think, now, if I had not reason to bless newspapers and civilization! Imagine me alone in the 
very centre of this vast wild country, a storm raging without, as if heaven and earth had come in collision—lodged
and cared for, reclining on a neat comfortable bed, and reading by the light of one tallow candle, (for there was a 
scarcity either of candles or of candlesticks,) <persName>Sergeant Talfourd</persName>'s speech in the <orgName>Commons</orgName> for the alteration of the 
law of copyright, given at full length, and if I had been worse than <q>"kilt entirely,"</q> his noble eulogy of <persName>Wordsworth</persName>
responded to by the cheers of the whole house, would have brought me to life; so did it make my very heart glow

<pb n="318"/><p><seg type="pagenumber">314</seg></p><p>In the same paper, and in the two provincial papers, I found whole columns extracted from <persName>Miss Martineau</persName>'s long
expected book on <placeName>America</placeName>. What I now read, fulfilled the highest expectations I had previously formed. There will,
of course, be diversity of opinion on many points; but one thing is clear; that she is a good woman, and a
lover of truth for truth's sake; and that she has written in a good and womanly spirit, candid and kind;—stern
sometimes, never sharp, never satirical. There is in these passages at least, an even tone of good-nature and 
good temper—of high principle and high feeling of everykind, which has added to my admiration of her, and makes 
me long more than ever to see the book itself. There are things in it, apparently, which will not yet be appreciated
—but all in good time.</p>
         <p>With regard to the law of copyright, I see in another part of the paper that the <roleName>publishers</roleName> 
have taken the alarm, and are beginning to bestir themselves against it. We shall have them crying out like the 
            <trait type="ethnicity"><label>French <roleName>actresses</roleName></label></trait>, <q>"C'est une chose étonnante qu'on ne trouve pas un moyen de se passer d'auteurs!"</q> Perhaps the
best thing at this moment for all parties would be an international law, which should protect both <roleName>authors</roleName> and 
<roleName>publishers</roleName>; for if they have no respect for the property which is the mere produce of the brain, perhaps they 
will respect and acknowledge the existence of property for which a man can prove he has paid hard money.</p>

         <p>The next morning the weather continued very lowering and stormy. I wrote out my little journal for you 
carefully thus far, and then I received several <roleName>visiters</roleName>, who hearing of my arrival, had come with kind offers
of hospitality and attention, such as are most grateful to a solitary stranger. I had also much conversation 
relative to the place and people, and the settlements around, and then I took a long walk about the town, of which
I here give you the results.</p>
         <p>When <persName>Governor Simcoe</persName> was planning the foundation of a capital for the whole province,
he fixed at first upon the present site of <placeName>London</placeName>, struck by its many and obvious advantages. Its central position, 
in the midst of these great lakes, being at an equal distance from <placeName>Huron</placeName>, <placeName>Erie</placeName>, and <placeName>Ontario</placeName>, in the finest and most 
fertile district of the whole province, on the bank of a beautiful stream, and at a safe distance from the frontier,
all pointed it out as the most eligible site for a metropolis; but there was the want of land and water 
communication—a want which still remains the only drawback to its rising prosperity. A canal or rail-road,
running from <placeName>Toronto</placeName> and <placeName>Hamilton</placeName> to <placeName>London</placeName>, then branching off on the right to the <placeName>harbor of Goderich</placeName> on 
<placeName>Lake Huron</placeName>, and on the left to <placeName>Sandwich</placeName> on <placeName>Lake Erie</placeName>, were a glorious thing!—the one thing 
            <pb n="320"/><seg type="pagenumber">316</seg>needful to make this fine country the granary and storehouse of the west; for here all grain, all fruits which 
flourish in the <placeName>south of Europe</placeName>, might be cultivated with success—the finest wheat and rice, and hemp and flax,
and tobacco. Yet, in spite of this want, soon, I trust, to be supplied, the town of <placeName>London</placeName> has sprung up and
become within ten years a place of great importance. In size and population it exceeds every town I have yet
visited, except <placeName>Toronto</placeName> and <placeName>Hamilton</placeName>. The first house was erected in <date>1827</date>; it now contains more than two hundred
frame or brick houses; and there are many more building. The population may be about thirteen hundred people. 
The jail and court-house, comprised in one large stately edifice, seemed the glory of the <roleName>townspeople</roleName>. As for
the style of architecture, I may not attempt to name or describe it; but a gentleman informed me, in rather 
equivocal phrase, that it was "<hi rend="italics">somewhat gothic</hi>." There are five places of worship, for the <trait type="religion"><label>Episcopalians</label></trait>, 
            <trait type="religion"><label>Presbyterians</label></trait>, <trait type="religion"><label>Methodists</label></trait>, <trait type="religion"><label>Roman Catholics</label></trait>, 
            and <trait type="religion"><label>Baptists</label></trait>. The church is handsome. There are also three or 
four schools, and seven taverns. The <placeName>Thames</placeName> is very beautiful here, and navigable for boats and barges. I saw 
to-day a large timber raft floating down the stream, containing many thousand feet of timber. On the whole, I 
have nowhere seen such evident signs of progress and prosperity.</p>
         <p>The population consists principally of <roleName>artisans</roleName>— 
as <roleName>blacksmiths</roleName>, <roleName>carpenters</roleName>, <roleName>builders</roleName>, all flourishing. There is, I fear, a good deal of drunkenness and 
            profligacy; for though the people have work and wealth,
            <pb n="321"/><seg type="pagenumber">317</seg>they have neither education nor amusements.*
            Besides the seven taverns, there is a number of little grocery stores
, which are, in fact, drinking houses. And though a law exists, which forbids the sale of spirituous liquors in 
small quantities by any but <roleName>licensed publicans</roleName>, they easily contrive to elude the law; as thus:—a <roleName>customer</roleName> 
enters the shop, and asks for two or three pennyworth of nuts, or cakes, and he receives a few nuts, and a large
glass of whiskey. The whiskey, you observe, is given, not sold, and no one can swear to the contrary. In the same
manner the severe law against selling intoxicating liquors to the <trait type="race"><label>poor Indians</label></trait> is continually eluded or 
violated, and there is no redress for the injured, no punishment to reach the guilty. It appears to me that the 
government should be more careful in the choice of the <roleName>district magistrates</roleName>. While I was in <placeName>London</placeName>, a person who
had acted in this capacity was carried from the pavement dead drunk.</p>
         <p>Here, as every where else, I find the women of the
<seg type="footnote">Hear <persName>Dr. Channing,</persName> the wise and the good:—"People," he says,
   "should be guarded against temptation to unlawful pleasures by furnishing the means of innocent ones. 
   In every community, there must be pleasures, relaxations, and means of agreeable excitement; and if
   innocent are not furnished, resort will be had to criminal. Man was made to enjoy as well as to labor; 
   and the state of society should be adapted to this principle of human nature."
   "Men drink to excess very often to shake off depression, or to satisfy the restless thirst for agreeable excitement,
   and these motives are excluded in a cheerful community." When I was in <placeName>Upper Canada,</placeName> I found
   no means whatever of social amusement for any class, except that which the tavern afforded; 
   taverns consequently abounded every where.</seg>
<pb n="322"/><seg type="pagenumber">318</seg>better class lamenting over the want of all society, except of the lowest grade in manners and morals. For those 
who have recently emigrated, and are settled more in the interior, there is absolutely no social intercourse 
whatever; it is quite out of the question. They seem to me perishing of ennui, or from the want of sympathy 
which they cannot obtain, and, what is worse, which they cannot feel; for being in general unfitted for out-door
occupations, unable to comprehend or enter into the interests around them, and all their earliest prejudices and
ideas of the fitness of things continually outraged in a manner exceedingly unpleasant, they may be said to 
live in a perpetual state of inward passive discord and fretful endurance— 
<lg><l>"All too timid and reserved</l>
<l>For onset, for resistance too inert—.</l> 
<l>Top weak for suffering, and for hope too tame."</l></lg></p>
<p>A gentleman, well known to me by name,
who was not a resident in <placeName>London</placeName>, but passing through it on his way from a far western settlement up by <placeName>Lake
Huron</placeName>, was one of my morning visiters. He had been settled in the Bush for five years, had a beautiful farm
, well cleared, well stocked. He was pleased with his prospects, his existence, his occupations: all he wanted
was a <roleName type="family">wife,</roleName> and on this subject he poured forth a most eloquent appeal.</p>
         <p>"Where," said he, " shall I find such 
a <roleName type="family">wife</roleName> as I could, with a safe conscience, bring into these wilds, to share a <roleName>settler</roleName>'s, fate, a <roleName>settler</roleName>'s home? You,
<pb n="323"/><seg type="pagenumber">319</seg>who know your own sex so well, point me out such a one, or tell me at least where to seek her. I am perishing and 
deteriorating, head and heart, for want of <roleName type="family">a companion—a wife,</roleName> in short. I am becoming as rude and coarse as my 
own <roleName>laborers</roleName>, and as hard as my own axe. If I wait <date when="1842">five years longer</date>, no woman will be able to endure such a fellow
as I shall be by that time—no woman, I mean, whom I could marry—for in this lies my utter unreasonableness; 
habituated to seek in woman those graces and refinements which I have always associated with her idea, I must
have them here in the forest, or dispense with all female society whatever. With some one to sympathize with 
me—to talk to—to embellish the home I return to at night—such a life as I now lead, with all the cares and
frivolities of a too artificial society cast behind us, security and plenty all around us, and nothing but 
hope before us, a life of <q>"cheerful yesterdays and confident to morrows"</q>—were it not delicious? I want for 
myself nothing more, nothing better; but—perhaps it is a weakness, an inconsistency!—I could not love a 
woman who was inferior to all my preconceived notions of feminine elegance and refinement—inferior to my own 
<roleName type="family">mother and sisters.</roleName> You know I was in <placeName>England</placeName> <date when="1835">two years ago</date>;—well, I have a vision of a beautiful creature, 
            with the figure of a sylph and the head of a sibyl, bending over her harp, and singing "<hi rend="italics">A te, О cara;</hi>" and 
            when I am logging in the woods with my men, I catch, myself meditating on that vision, and humming <hi rend="italics">A te, О cara</hi>, 
which somehow or other runs strangely in my head. Now,
<pb n="324"/><seg type="pagenumber">320</seg>what is to be done? What could I do with that fair vision here? Without coxcombry may I not say, that I need not
entirely despair of winning the affections of an amiable, elegant woman, and might even persuade her to confront, 
for my sake, worse than all this? For what will not your sex do and dare for the sake of us men creatures, savages
that we are? But even for that reason shall I take advantage of such sentiments? You know what this life is—this
isolated life in the Bush—and so do I; but by what words could I make it comprehensible to a fine lady? Certainly
I might draw such a picture of it as should delight by its novelty and romance, and deceive even while it does not
deviate from the truth. A cottage in the wild woods—solitude and love—the world forgetting, by the world forgot—the
deer come skipping by—the <trait type="race"><label>red Indian</label></trait> brings game, and lays it at her feet—how pretty and how romantic! And for the 
first few months, perhaps the first year, all goes well; but how goes it the next, and the next? I have observed 
with regard to the women who come out, that they do well enough the first year, and some even the second; but the
third is generally fatal: and the worst with you women—or the best shall I not say?—is, that you cannot, and do
not, forget domestic ties left behind. We men go out upon our land, or to the chase, and the women, poor souls, sit,
and sew, and <hi rend="italics">think</hi>. You have seen <persName>Mrs. A.</persName> and <persName>Mrs. В.</persName>, who came out here, as I well remember, full of health and 
bloom—what are they now? premature old women, sickly, care-worn, without nerve or
<pb n="325"/><seg type="pagenumber">321</seg>cheerfulness:—and as for <persName>C------</persName>, who brought his <roleName type="family">wife</roleName> to his place by <placeName>Lake Simcoe</placeName> only <date when="1834">three years ago</date>, I hear the poor
fellow must sell all off, or see his <roleName type="family">wife</roleName> perish before his eyes. Would you have me risk the alternative? Or perhaps
you will say, marry one of the women of the country—one of the <roleName type="family">daughters</roleName> <hi rend="italics">of the Bush</hi>. No, I cannot; I must have 
something different. I may not have been particularly fortunate, but the women I have seen are in general coarse 
and narrow minded, with no education whatever, or with an education which apes all I most dislike, and omits all I
could admire in the fashionable education of the <placeName>old country</placeName>. What could I do with such women? In the former I might
find an <roleName>upper servant</roleName>, but no companion—in the other, neither companionship nor help!"</p>
         <p>To this discontented and 
fastidious gentleman I ventured to recommend two or three very amiable girls I had known at <placeName>Toronto</placeName> and <placeName>Niagara</placeName>; and
I told him, too, that among the beautiful and spirited girls of <placeName>New-England</placeName>, he might also find what would answer his 
            purpose. But with regard to <trait type="ethnicity"><label>Englishwomen</label></trait> of that grade in station and education, and personal attraction, which would 
content him, I could not well speak; not because I knew of none who united grace of person and lively talents with 
capabilities of strong affection, ay, and sufficient energy of character to meet trials and endure privations; 
but in women, as now educated, there is a strength of local habits and attachments, a want of cheerful self-dependence,
a cherished physical delicacy, a weakness of temperament,—deemed, and
<pb n="326"/><seg type="pagenumber">322</seg>falsely deemed, in deference to the pride of man, essential to feminine grace and refinement,—altogether unfitting 
them for a life which were otherwise delightful:—the active out-of-door life in which she must share and sympathize,
and the in-door occupations which in <placeName>England</placeName> are considered servile; for a woman who cannot perform for herself
and others all household offices, has no business here. But when I hear some men declare that they cannot endure
to see women eat, and others speak of brilliant health and strength in young girls as being rude and vulgar, with
various notions of the same kind too grossly absurd and perverted even for ridicule, I cannot wonder at any 
nonsensical affectations I meet within my own sex; nor do otherwise than pity the mistakes and deficiencies 
of those who are sagely brought up with the one end and aim—to get married. As you always used to say, <q>"Let there
be a demand for a better article, and a better article will be supplied."</q></p>
         <p>A woman, blessed with good health, a
cheerful spirit, larger capabilities of reflection and action, some knowledge of herself, her own nature, and the
common lot of humanity, with a plain understanding, which has been allowed to throw itself out unwarped by sickly
fancies and prejudices,—such a woman would be as happy in <placeName>Canada</placeName> as any where in the world. A weak, frivolous, 
half-educated, or ill-educated woman may be as miserable in the heart of <placeName>London</placeName> as in the heart of the forest. But 
there her deficiencies are not so injurious, and are
<pb n="327"/><seg type="pagenumber">323</seg>supplied to herself and others by the circumstances and advantages around her.</p>
         <p>I have heard (and seen) it laid down
as a principle, that the purpose—one purpose at least—of education is to fit us for the circumstances in which
we are likely to be placed. I deny it absolutely. Even if it could be exactly known (which it cannot) what those 
circumstances may be, I should still deny it. Education has a far higher object. I remember to have read of some 
            <trait type="ethnicity"><label>Russian <roleName>prince</roleName></label></trait> (was it not <persName>Potemkin</persName>?) who, when he travelled, was preceded by a <roleName>gardener</roleName>, who around his marquee
scattered an artificial soil, and stuck into it shrubs and bouquets of flowers, which, while assiduously watered,
looked pretty for twenty-four hours perhaps, then withered or were plucked up. What shallow barbarism to take 
pleasure in such a mockery of a garden! better the wilderness, better the waste! that forest, that rock yonder, 
with creeping weeds around it! An education that is to fit us for circumstances, seems to me like that <trait type="ethnicity"><label>Russian 
garden</label></trait>. No; the true purpose of education is to cherish and unfold the seed of immortality already sown within us; 
to develope, to their fullest extent, the capacities of every kind with which the God who made us has endowed us. 
Then we shall be fitted for all circumstances, or know how to fit circumstances to ourselves. Fit us for circumstances!
Base and mechanical! Why not set up at once a "<hi rend="italics">fabrique d'éducation</hi>," and educate us by steam? The human soul, 
be it man's or woman's, is not, I suppose, an empty bottle, into which you shall pour and cram
<pb n="328"/><seg type="pagenumber">324</seg>just what you like, and as you like; nor a plot of waste soil, in which you shall sow what you like; but a divine,
a living germ planted by an almighty hand, which you may indeed render more or less productive, or train to this or 
that form—no more. And when you have taken the oak sapling, and dwarfed it, and pruned it, and twisted it, into
an ornament for the jardinière in your drawing-room, much have you gained truly; and a pretty figure your
specimen is like to make in the broad plain and under the free air of heaven!</p>
<pb n="329"/><p><seg type="pagenumber">325</seg></p><p>The plan of travel I had laid down for myself did not permit of my making any long stay in <placeName>London</placeName>, I was anxious
   to push on to the <placeName>Talbot Settlement</placeName>, or, as it is called here, the <placeName>Talbot <hi rend="italics">Country</hi></placeName>, a name not ill applied to 
a vast tract of land stretching from east to west along the shore of <placeName>Lake Erie</placeName>, and of which <persName>Colonel Talbot</persName> is
   the <roleName>sovereign</roleName> <hi rend="italics">de facto</hi>, if not <hi rend="italics">de jure</hi>—be it spoken without any derogation to the rights of our lord the <roleName>king</roleName>.
This immense settlement, the circumstances to which it owed its existence, and the character of the eccentric 
man who founded it on such principles as have insured its success and prosperity, altogether inspired me with 
the strongest interest and curiosity.</p>
         <p>To the residence of this "big <roleName>chief</roleName>," as an <trait type="race"><label>Indian</label></trait> styled him—a solitary
mansion on a cliff above <placeName>Lake Erie</placeName>, where he lived alone in his glory—was I now bound, without exactly knowing 
what reception I was to meet there, for that was a point which the despotic habits and eccentricities of this 
<roleName>hermit-lord</roleName> of the forest rendered a little doubtful. The reports I had heard of his singular manners, of his 
being a sort of woman-hater, who had not for thirty years allowed a female to appear in his sight. I had partly 
discredited, yet enough remained to make me feel a little nervous. However, my resolution was taken, and the 
            <roleName>colonel</roleName> had been apprized of my intended visit, though of his gracious acquiescence I was yet <seg type="pagesignature">vol. I. 28</seg>
<pb n="330"/><seg type="pagenumber">326</seg>to learn; so, putting my trust in Providence, as heretofore, I prepared to encounter the 
old buffalo in his lair.</p>
         <p>From the <roleName>master</roleName> of the inn at <placeName>London</placeName> I hired a vehicle and a driver for eight dollars.
            The distance was about thirty miles; the road, as my <trait type="ethnicity"><label>Irish informant</label></trait> assured me, was quite "iligant!" but hilly,
and so broken by the recent storms, that it was thought I could not reach my destination before nightfall, 
and I was advised to sleep at the little town of <placeName>St. Thomas</placeName>, about twelve or fifteen miles on this side of 
<placeName>Port Talbot</placeName>. However, I was resolute to try, and, with a pair of stout horses and a willing driver, did not 
despair. My conveyance from <placeName>Blandford</placeName> had been a <roleName>baker</roleName>'s cart on springs; but springs were a luxury I was in
future to dispense with. My present vehicle, the best to be procured, was a common cart, with straw at the 
bottom; in the midst a seat was suspended on straps, and furnished with a cushion, not of the softest. A
board nailed across the front served for the <roleName>driver</roleName>, a quiet, demure-looking boy of fifteen or sixteen, with 
a round straw hat and a fustian jacket. Such was the elegant and appropriate equipage in which the
"<roleName>chancellor</roleName>'s lady," as they call me here, paid her first visit of state to the "great <persName>Colonel Talbot</persName>."</p>
         <p>On leaving the town, we crossed the <placeName>Thames</placeName> on a wooden bridge, and turned to the south through a very beautiful
valley, with cultivated farms and extensive clearings on every side. I was now in the <placeName>Talbot country</placeName>, 
and had the advantage of travelling on part of the road constructed under the <roleName>colonel</roleName>'s
<pb n="331"/><seg type="pagenumber">327</seg>direction, which, compared with those I had recently travelled, was better than tolerable.
While we were slowly ascending an eminence, I took the opportunity of entering into some discourse with
my <roleName>driver</roleName>, whose very demure and thoughtful though boyish face, and very brief but pithy and intelligent 
replies to some of my questions on the road, had excited my attention. Though perfectly civil, and 
remarkably self-possessed, he was not communicative or talkative; I had to pluck out the information 
blade by blade, as it were. And here you have my catechism, with question and response, word for word,
as nearly as possible.</p>
         <p>" Were you born in this country?"</p>
         <p>No; I'm from the <placeName>old country</placeName>."</p>
<p>"From what part of it?"</p>
         <p>From about <placeName>Glasgow</placeName>."</p> 
            <p>What is your name?"</p>
         <p>"<persName>Sholto---------</persName>."</p>
         <p>"<persName>Sholto</persName>!—that is rather an uncommon name, is it not?"</p>
         <p>"I was called <persName>Sholto</persName> after a son of <persName>Lord Douglas</persName>. My <roleName type="family">father</roleName> was 
<persName>Lord Douglas</persName>'s <roleName>gardener</roleName>."</p>
         <p>"How long have you been here?"</p>
         <p>"I came over with my <roleName type="family">father</roleName> about five years ago." (In <date>1832</date>.)</p>
         <p>"How came your <roleName type="family">father</roleName> to emigrate?"</p>
         <p>My <roleName type="family">father</roleName> was one of the <roleName>commuted pensioners</roleName>, 
as they call them.* 
            He was an old <roleName>soldier</roleName> in the <orgName>veteran battalion</orgName>, and he sold his pension of five-
            <seg type="footnote">Of the commuted <roleName>pensioners,</roleName> and their fate in <placeName>Canada,</placeName> more will be said hereafter.</seg> 
 <pb n="332"/><seg type="pagenumber">328</seg>pence a day for four years and a grant of land, and came out here. Many did the like."</p>
         <p>"But if he was
<roleName>gardener</roleName> to <persName>Lord Douglas</persName>, he could not have suffered from want?"</p>
         <p>"Why, he was not a <roleName>gardener</roleName> <hi rend="italics">then</hi>;
he was a <roleName>weaver</roleName>; he worked hard enough for us. I remember often waking in the middle of the night,
and seeing my <roleName type="family">father</roleName> working still at his loom, as if he would never give over, while my <roleName type="family">mother</roleName> and 
all of us were asleep."</p>
         <p>"All of us !—how many of you?"</p>
         <p>"There were six of us; but my eldest brother and myself could do something."</p>
         <p>"And you all emigrated with your <roleName type="family">father?"</roleName></p>
         <p>" Why, you see, at last he couldn't get no work, and trade was dull, and we were nigh starving. I remember I was always hungry
then—always."</p>
         <p>"And you all came out?"</p>
         <p>"All but my eldest brother. When we were on the way to the 
ship, he got frightened and turned back, and wouldn't come. My poor <roleName type="family">mother</roleName> cried very much, and begged
him hard. Now the last we hear of him is, that he is very badly off, and can't get no work at all."</p>
         <p>"Is your <roleName type="family">father</roleName> yet alive?"</p>
         <p>"Yes, he has land up in <placeName>Adelaide</placeName>."</p>
         <p>"Is your <roleName type="family">mother</roleName> alive?"</p>
         <p>"No; she died of the cholera, coming over. You see the cholera broke out in the ship, and fifty-three people 
died, one after t'other, and were thrown into the sea. My <roleName type="family">mother</roleName> died, and they threw her into the 
sea. And then my little sister, only nine months
<pb n="333"/><seg type="pagenumber">329</seg>old, died, because there was nobody to take care of her, and they threw her into the sea—poor little
thing!"</p>
         <p>"Was it not dreadful to see the people dying around you? Did you not feel frightened for 
yourself?"</p>
         <p>"Well—I don't know—one got used to it—it was nothing but splash, splash, all day 
long—first one, then another. There was one <persName>Martin</persName> on board, I remember, with a <roleName type="family">wife</roleName> and <roleName type="family">nine 
children—</roleName> one of those as sold his pension: he had fought in <placeName>Spain</placeName> with the <persName>Duke of Wellington</persName>. 
Well, first his <roleName type="family">wife</roleName> died, and they threw her into the sea; and then he died, and they threw him 
into the sea; and then the <roleName type="family">children,</roleName> one after t'other, till only two were left alive; the 
eldest, a girl about thirteen, who had nursed them all, one after another, and seen them die—well,
            <hi rend="italics">she</hi> died, and then there was only the little fellow left."</p>
         <p>"And what became of him?"</p>
         <p>" He went back, as I heard, in the same ship with the <roleName>captain</roleName>."</p>
         <p>"And did you not think sometimes it 
might be your turn next?"</p>
         <p>"No—I didn't; and then I was down with the fever."</p>
         <p>"What do you mean by <hi rend="italics">the fever</hi>?"</p>
         <p>"Why, you see, I was looking at some fish that was going by the ship in shoals,
as they call it. It was very pretty, and I never saw any thing like it, and I stood watching over the
ship's side all day long. It poured rain, and I was wet through and <seg type="pagesignature">28*</seg>
<pb n="334"/><seg type="pagenumber">330</seg>through, and felt very cold, and I went into my berth and pulled the blanket around me, and fell 
asleep. After that I had the fever very bad. I didn't know when we landed at <placeName>Quebec</placeName>, and after that
I didn't know where we were for five weeks, nor nothing."</p>
         <p>I assured him that this was only a natural 
and necessary consequence of his own conduct, and took the opportunity to explain to him some of those
simple laws by which he held both health and existence, to all which he listened with an intelligent 
look, and thanked me cordially, adding—</p>
         <p>"Then I wonder I didn't die! and it was a great mercy I didn't."</p> 
<p>"I hope you will live to think so, and be thankful to Heaven. And so you were detained at <placeName>Quebec</placeName>?"</p>
         <p>"Yes; my <roleName type="family">father</roleName> had some money to receive of his pension, but what with my illness and the expense of living,
it soon went; and then he sold his silver watch, and that brought us on to <placeName>York</placeName>—that's <placeName>Toronto</placeName> now. And 
then there was a schooner provided by government to take us on board, and we had rations provided, and 
that brought us on to <placeName>Port Stanley</placeName>, far below <placeName>Port Talbot</placeName>; and then they put us ashore, and we had to find
our way, and pay our way, to <placeName>Delaware</placeName>, where our lot of land was; that cost eight dollars; and then we
had nothing left—nothing at all. There were nine hundred <roleName>emigrants</roleName> encamped about <placeName>Delaware</placeName>, no better off
than ourselves."</p>
         <p>"What did you do then? Had you not to build a house?"</p>
<pb n="335"/><p><seg type="pagenumber">331</seg></p><p>"No; the government built each family a house, that is to say, a log-hut, eighteen feet long, with a hole
for the chimney; no glass in the windows, and empty of course; not a bit of furniture, not even a table 
or a chair."</p>
         <p>"And how did you live?"</p>
         <p>"Why, the first year, my <roleName type="family">father</roleName> and us, we cleared a couple of acres,
and sowed wheat enough for next year."</p>
         <p>"But meantime you must have existed—and without food or money—?"</p> 
<p>"O, why we worked meantime on the roads and got half a dollar a day and rations."</p>
         <p>"It must have been rather a hard life?"</p> 
         <p>"<hi rend="italics">Hard!</hi> yes, I believe it was; why, many of them couldn't stand it, no ways. Some died;
and then there were the <roleName type="family">poor children</roleName> and the women—it was very bad for them. Some wouldn't sit down on 
their land at all; they lost all heart to see every where trees, and nothing beside. And then they didn't
know nothing of farming—how should they? being <roleName>soldiers</roleName> by trade. There was one <persName>Jim Grey</persName>, of father's 
<orgName>regiment</orgName>—he didn't know how to handle his axe, but he could handle his gun well; so he went and shot 
deer, and sold them to the others; but one day we missed him, and he never came back; and we thought the
bears had got him, or may be he cleared off to <placeName>Michigan</placeName>—there's no knowing."</p>
         <p>"And your <roleName type="family">father?"</roleName></p>
         <p>"O, he stuck to his land, and he has now five acres cleared: and he's planted a bit of a garden,
<pb n="336"/><seg type="pagenumber">332</seg>and he has two cows and a calf, and two pigs; and he's got his house comfortable—and stopped up the holes,
and built himself a chimney."</p>
         <p>"That's well; but why are you not with them?"</p>
         <p>"О, he married again, and he's got <roleName type="family"> children,</roleName> and I didn't like my <roleName type="family">stepmother,</roleName> because she didn't use my sisters well, and so I
came away."</p>
         <p>"Where are your sisters now?"</p>
         <p>"Both out at service, and they get good wages; one gets four,
and the other gets five dollars a month. Then I've a brother younger than myself, and he's gone to work 
with а <roleName>shoemaker</roleName> at <placeName>London</placeName>. But the man drinks hard—like a great many here—and I am afeard my brother will
learn to drink, and that frets me; and he won't come away, though I could get him a good place any day—
no want of places here, and good wages too."</p>
         <p>"What wages do you receive?"</p>
         <p>"Seven dollars a month and my board. Next month I shall have eight."</p>
         <p>"I hope you put by some of your wages?"</p>
         <p>"Why, I bought a yoke of steers for my <roleName type="family">father</roleName> last fall, as cost me thirty dollars, but they won't be fit for ploughing these
two years."</p>
         <p>(I should inform you perhaps, that a yoke of oxen fit for ploughing costs about eighty dollars.)</p>
<p>I pointed out to him the advantages of his present situation, compared with what might have been his fate
in the <placeName>old country</placeName>, and urged him to avoid all temptations to drink, which he promised.</p>
         <p>"You can read, I suppose?"</p>
         <p>He hesitated, and looked down. "I can read in
            <pb n="337"/><seg type="pagenumber">333</seg>the <trait type="religion"><label>Testament</label></trait> a little. I never had no other book. But this winter," looking up brightly,—"I intend to give
myself some schooling. A man who has reading and writing, and a pair of hands, and keeps sober, may make a 
fortune here—and so will I, with God's blessing!"</p>
         <p>Here he gave his whip a very expressive flourish. We were
now near the summit of a hill, which he called <placeName>Bear Hill</placeName>; the people, he said, gave it that name because 
of the number of bears which used to be found here. Nothing could exceed the beauty and variety of the timber
trees, intermingled with the most luxuriant underwood, and festooned with the wild grape and flowering 
creepers. It was some time, he said, since a bear had been shot in these woods; but only last spring one of
his <roleName>comrades</roleName> had found a bear's cub, which he had fed and taken care of, and had sold within the last few 
weeks to a <roleName>travelling menagerie</roleName> of wild beasts for five dollars.</p>
         <p>On reaching the summit of this hill, I found 
myself on the highest land I had yet stood upon in <placeName>Canada</placeName>, with the exception of <placeName>Queenston heights</placeName>. I stopped
the horses and looked around, and on every side, far and near, east, west, north, and south, it was all 
forest—a boundless sea of forest, within whose leafy recesses lay hidden as infinite variety of life and movement
as within the depths of the ocean; and it reposed in the moontide so still and so vast! Here the bright 
sunshine rested on it in floods of golden light; <hi rend="italics">there</hi> cloud-shadows sped over its bosom, just like the 
effects I remember to have seen on the <placeName>Atlantic</placeName>; and here and there rose wreaths of white
<pb n="338"/><seg type="pagenumber">334</seg>smoke from the new clearings, which, collected into little silver clouds, and hung suspended in the quiet air.</p>
         <p>I gazed and meditated till, by a process like that of the <trait type="ethnicity"><label>Arabian sorcerer</label></trait> of old, the present fell like a film
from my eyes: the future was before me, with its towns and cities, fields of waving grain, green lawns and
villas, and churches, and temples—turret-crowned: and meadows tracked by the frequent, foot-path; and 
railroads, with trains of rich merchandise steaming along:—for all this <hi rend="italics">will</hi> be! Will be? <hi rend="italics">It is</hi> already 
in the sight of Him who hath ordained it, and for whom there is no past nor future: though I cannot behold it
with my bodily vision, even <hi rend="italics">now</hi> it is.</p>
         <p>But is <hi rend="italics">that</hi> now better than <hi rend="italics">this</hi> present now? When these forests, with 
all their solemn depth of shade and multitudinous life have fallen beneath the axe—when the wolf, and bear, and 
deer are driven from their native coverts, and all this infinitude of animal and vegetable being has made way for 
restless, erring, suffering humanity, will it then be better? <hi rend="italics">Better</hi>—I know not; but surely it will be <hi rend="italics">well</hi>,
and right in His eyes who has ordained that thus the course of things shall run. Those who see nothing in 
<trait type="race"><label>civilized</label></trait> life but its complicated cares, mistakes, vanities, and miseries, may doubt this—or despair. 
For myself and you too, my friend, we are of those who believe and hope; who behold in progressive civilization,
progressive happiness, progressive approximation to nature and to nature's God; for are we not in His hands 
?—and all that He does is good.
<pb n="339"/><seg type="pagenumber">335</seg>Contemplations such as these were in my mind as we descended the <placeName>Hill of Bears</placeName>, and proceeded through a beautiful 
plain, sometimes richly wooded, sometimes opening into clearings and cultivated farms, on which were usually 
compact farm-houses, each flanked by a barn three times as large as the house, till we came on to a place called 
<placeName>Five Stakes</placeName>, where I found two or three tidy cottages, and procured some bread and milk. The road here was no 
longer so good, and we travelled slowly and with difficulty for some miles. About five o'clock we reached <placeName>St.
Thomas</placeName>, one of the prettiest places I had yet seen. Here I found two or three inns, and at one of them, styled 
the "<placeName>Mansion House Hotel</placeName>," I ordered tea for myself and good entertainment for my young <roleName>driver</roleName> and his horses, 
and then walked out.</p>
         <p><placeName>St. Thomas</placeName> is situated on a high eminence, to which the ascent is rather abrupt. The view 
from it, over a fertile, well settled country, is very beautiful and cheering. The place bears the christian 
name of <persName>Colonel Talbot</persName>, who styles it his capital, and, from a combination of advantages, it is rising fast into
importance. The climate, from its high position, is delicious and healthful; and the winters in this part 
of the province are milder by several degrees than elsewhere. At the foot of the cliff, or eminence, runs a
deep rapid stream, called the <placeName>Kettle Creek</placeName>,* (I wish
<seg type="footnote">When I remonstrated against this name for so beautiful a stream,
   <persName>Colonel Talbot</persName> told me that his first <roleName>settlers</roleName> had found a kettle on the bank,
   left by some <trait type="race"><label>Indians,</label></trait> and had given the river, from this slight circumstance,
   a name which he had not thought it worth while to alter.</seg>
<pb n="340"/><seg type="pagenumber">336</seg>they had given it a prettier name,) which, after a course of eight miles, and turning a variety of sawmills, 
grist-mills, &amp;c., flows into <placeName>Lake Erie</placeName>, at <placeName>Port Stanley</placeName>, one of the best harbors on this side of the lake. 
Here steamboats and schooners land <roleName>passengers</roleName> and merchandise, or load with grain, flour, lumber. The roads 
are good all round; and the <placeName>Talbot road</placeName>, carried directly through the town, is the finest in the province. This 
road runs nearly parallel with <placeName>Lake Erie</placeName>, from thirty miles below <placeName>Port Stanley</placeName>, westward as far as <placeName>Delaware</placeName>. The 
population of <placeName>St. Thomas</placeName> is at present rated at seven hundred, and it has doubled within two years. There are three
churches, one of which is very neat; and three taverns. Two newspapers are published here, one violently 
<orgName>tory</orgName>, the other as violently <orgName>radical</orgName>. I found several houses building, and in those I entered a general air 
of cheerfulness and well-being very pleasing to contemplate. There is here an excellent manufacture of cabinet
ware and furniture; some articles of the black walnut, a tree abounding here, appeared to me more beautiful in 
color and grain than the finest mahogany; and the elegant veining of the maplewood cannot be surpassed. I 
wish they were sufficiently the fashion in <placeName>England</placeName> to make the transport worth while. Here I have seen whole
piles, nay, whole forests of such trees, burning together.</p>
         <p>I was very much struck with this beautiful and 
cheerful little town, more, I think, than with any place I have yet seen.</p>
         <p>By the time my horses were refreshed, it was near
<pb n="341"/><seg type="pagenumber">337</seg>seven o'clock. The distance from <placeName>Port Talbot</placeName> is about twelve miles, but hearing the road was good, I 
resolved to venture. The sky looked turbulent and stormy, but luckily the storm was moving one way while 
I was moving another; and, except a little sprinkling from the tail of a cloud, we escaped very well.</p>
         <p>The road presented on either side a succeseion of farm-houses and well-cultivated farms. Near the houses 
            there was generally a patch of ground planted with <trait type="race"><label>Indian corn</label></trait> and pumpkins, and sometimes a few cabbages
and potatoes. I do not recollect to have seen one garden, or the least attempt to cultivate flowers.</p> 
<p>The goodness of the road is owing to the systematic regulations of <persName>Colonel Talbot</persName>. Throughout the whole 
"country" none can obtain land without first applying to him, and the price and conditions are uniform
and absolute. The lands are divided into lots of two hundred acres, and to each <roleName>settler</roleName> fifty acres are 
given gratis, and one hundred and fifty at three dollars an acre. Each <roleName>settler</roleName> must clear and sow ten 
acres of land, build a house, (a log-hut of eighteen feet in length,) and construct one chain of road 
in front of his house, within three years; failing in this, he forfeits his deed.</p>
         <p><persName>Colonel Talbot</persName> does not like <roleName>gentlemen settlers</roleName>, nor will he have any settlements within a certain distance of his own 
domain. He never associates with the people except on one grand occasion, the anniversary of the foundation
of his settlement. This is celebrated at <placeName>St. Thomas</placeName> by a festive meeting of <seg type="pagesignature">VOL. IV. 29</seg>
<pb n="342"/><seg type="pagenumber">338</seg>the most respectable <roleName>settlers</roleName>, and the <roleName>colonel</roleName> himself opens the ball with one of the ladies, generally
showing his taste by selecting the youngest and prettiest.</p>
         <p>The evening now began to close in, night came 
on, with the stars and the fair young moon in her train. I felt much fatigued, and my young <roleName>driver</roleName> appeared 
to be out in his reckoning—that is, with regard to distance—for luckily he could not miss the way, there 
being but one. I stopped a man who was trudging along with an axe on his shoulder, "How far to <persName>Colonel
Talbot</persName>'s?" "About three miles and a half." This was encouraging; but a quarter of an hour afterwards, 
on asking the same question of another, he replied, "About seven miles." A third informed me that it
was about three miles beyond <persName>Major Burwell</persName>'s. The next person I met advised me to put up at."<persName>Waters</persName>'s," 
and not think of going any farther to-night; however, on arriving at <persName>Mr. Waters</persName>'s hotel, I was not 
particularly charmed with the prospect of a night's rest within its precincts. It was a long-shaped wooden
house, comfortless in appearance; a number of men were drinking at the bar, and sounds of revelry 
issued from the open door. I requested my driver to proceed, which he did with all willingness.</p>
         <p>We had travelled nearly the whole day through open well-cleared land, more densely peopled than any part of the 
province I had seen since I left the <placeName>Niagara district</placeName>. Suddenly we came upon a thick wood, through which
the road ran due west, in a straight line. The shadows fell deeper and deeper
<pb n="343"/><seg type="pagenumber">339</seg>from the depth of foliage on either side, and I could not see a yard around, but exactly before me the 
last gleams of twilight lingered where the moon was setting. Once or twice I was startled by seeing a deer
bound across the path, his large antlers being for one instant defined, <hi rend="italics">pencilled</hi>, as it were, against 
the sky, then lost. The darkness fell deeper every moment, the silence more solemn. The whip-poor-will began 
his melancholy cry, and an owl sent forth a prolonged shriek, which, if I had not heard it before, would
have frightened me. After a while my <roleName>driver</roleName> stopped and listened, and I could plainly hear the tinkling of
cow-bells. I thought this a good sign, till the boy reminded me that it was the custom of the <roleName>settlers</roleName> to 
turn their cattle loose in the summer to seek their own food, and that they often strayed miles from the 
clearing.</p>
         <p>We were proceeding along our dark path very slowly, for fear of accidents, when I heard the 
approaching tread of a horse, and the welcome sound of a man whistling. The boy hailed him with some 
impatience in his voice, "I say!—mister! whereabouts is <persName>Colonel Talbot</persName>'s?"</p> 
         <p>"The <roleName>Colonel</roleName>'s? why, 
straight afore you;—follow your nose, you buzzard!"</p>
         <p>Here I interposed. "Be so good, friend, as to inform
me how far we are yet from <persName>Colonel Talbot</persName>'s house?"</p>
         <p>"Who have you got here?" cried the man in surprise.</p>
<p>"A lady, comed over the sea to visit the <roleName>Colonel</roleName>."</p>
         <p>"Then," said the man, approaching my carriage
<pb n="344"/><seg type="pagenumber">340</seg>—my cart, I should say,—with much respect, "I guess you're the lady that the <roleName>Colonel</roleName> has been looking 
out for this week past. Why, I've been three times to <placeName>St. Thomas</placeName>'s with the team after you!"</p>
         <p>"I'm very sorry you've had that trouble!"</p>
         <p>"О no trouble at all—shall I ride back and tell him you're coming?"</p>
         <p>This I declined, for the poor man was evidently going home to his supper. To hear that the formidable <roleName>Colonel</roleName> was 
anxiously expecting me was very encouraging, and, from the man's description, I supposed that we were close 
to the house. Not so; the road, mocking my impatience, took so many bends, and sweeps, and windings, up
hill and down hill, that it was an eternity before we arrived. The <roleName>Colonel</roleName> piques himself exceedingly on 
this graceful and picturesque approach to his residence, and not without reason; but on the present occasion
I could have preferred a line more direct to the line of beauty. The darkness, which concealed its charms,
left me sensible only to its length.</p>
         <p>On ascending some high ground, a group of buildings was dimly descried.
And after oversetting part of a snake-fence before we found an entrance, we drove цр to the door. Lights were 
gleaming in the windows, and the <roleName>Colonel</roleName> sallied forth with prompt gallantry to receive me.</p>
         <p>My welcome was not only cordial, but courtly. The <roleName>Colonel</roleName>, taking me under his arm, and ordering the boy and his horses to 
be well taken care of, banded me into the hall or vestibule, where sacks of
<pb n="345"/><seg type="pagenumber">341</seg>wheat and piles of sheep-skins lay heaped in primitive fashion; thence into a room, the walls of which were 
formed of naked logs. Here no fauteuil, spring-cushioned, extended its comfortable arms—no sofa here 
<q>"insidiously stretched out its lazy length;"</q> <persName>Colonel Talbot</persName> held all such luxuries in sovereign contempt. 
In front of a capacious chimney stood a long wooden table, flanked with two wooden chairs, cut from the 
forest in the midst of which they now stood. To one of these the <roleName>Colonel</roleName> handed me, with the air of a <roleName>courtier</roleName>,
and took the other himself. Like all men who live out of the world, he retained a lively curiosity as to 
what was passing in it, and I was pressed with a profusion of questions as well as hospitable attentions; but wearied,
exhausted, aching in every nerve, the spirit with which I had at first met him in his own style, was fast ebbing.
I could neither speak nor eat, and was soon dismissed to repose.</p> 
         <p>With courteous solicitude, he ushered me himself 
to the door of a comfortable, well furnished bedroom, where a fire blazed cheerfully, where <roleName>female hands</roleName> had 
evidently presided to arrange my toilet, and where <roleName>female aid</roleName> awaited me;—so much had the good <roleName>Colonel</roleName> been calumniated!</p>
