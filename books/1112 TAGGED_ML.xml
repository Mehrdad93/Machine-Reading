      <p><title>PREFACE.</title>
        </p>
      <p><hi rend="italics">The speedy sale of the first edition of this work has induced the
            publishers to use their best endeavours to make the present one still more worthy of
            public encouragement, by subjecting it to such alterations and improvements as were
            judged necessary to complete its design,—and of which it may be here proper to give some
            account.</hi></p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">The many imperfections of stile and composition which but too
            evidently debased the first impression are attempted to be rectified in this. Some
            additional matter is introduced into the body of the text, and a few notes are inserted
            on incidental subjects, which were thought to be properly allied to the leading one.
            Besides an elegant frontispiece, an</hi>
          <w rend="smallcaps">Addenda</w>
          <hi rend="italics">is subjoined, containing a collection of several valuable miscellaneous
            pieces which have occasionally appeared respecting the lakes. And a friend of the
            publishers' has communicated an original article, called</hi>
          <hi rend="smallcaps">A Tour to the Caves</hi>, <hi rend="italics">which it is hoped will
            not only entertain, but be found particularly accurate as to matter of fact.—In short,
            the publishers have done every thing in their power to make this</hi>
          <w rend="smallcaps">Guide</w>
          <hi rend="italics">as complete and useful as its object is curious and popular</hi>.</p>

            manual to wish to know something of its 
            <roleName>author</roleName>, and the pretensions he has to claim
            their implicit confidence in the character he assumes This curiosity may now be properly
            indulged, as he is no longer within the reach of either praise or censure:—But what we
            have to say on the subject will be very short.</hi></p>

            of this tract and also of the</hi>
          <hi rend="smallcaps">Antiquities of Furness</hi>, <hi rend="italics">is supposed to have
            had the chief part of his education on the Continent, where he afterwards presided as a
            professor in some of the branches of natural philosophy: Whence it will appear, that
            though, upon some account or other, he had not acquired the habit of composing correctly
            in English, he must nevertheless have been a man of learning. He had feen many parts
            of</hi>
          <w rend="smallcaps">Europe</w>, <hi rend="italics">and considered what was extraordinary
            in them with a curious, if not with a judicious and philosophic eye. Having in the
            latter part of his life much leisure time on his hands, he frequently accompanied
            genteel parties on the</hi>
          <hi rend="smallcaps">Tour of the Lakes</hi>; <hi rend="italics">and after he had formed
            the design of drawing up his</hi>
          <w rend="smallcaps">Guide</w>, <hi rend="italics">besides consulting the most esteemed
            writers on the subject (as Dr.</hi>

        <p><hi rend="italics">concerning them, from the neighbouring gentlemen, as he thought
            necessary to complete the work, and make it truly deserving of its title. From these
            particulars, and the internal evidence of the following pages, it is presumed the reader
            will be satisfied, that the <roleName>author</roleName> was, in the most essential respects, well qualified
            for his undertaking. And should some of his digressions into antiquity be thought too
            long, or a few descriptions want precision, and now and then a station be dubiously
            pointed out,—if on the whole, the matter be selected by no uniform plan, let it be
            remembered few 
          <roleName>writers</roleName> 
          of tours have been able to avoid blemishes of this kind, and that
            the chief end of the work is accomplished, if, along due copiousness, it be authentic in
            the principal articles of local information.</hi></p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">Before the <roleName>author's</roleName> death (which happened very lately*) he had
            collected some new matter for this tract, which is introduced in the present edition in
            the manner he designed; but the revision of the language, &amp;c. mentioned above, fell
            of course to another person; and, in justice to him and the <roleName>author</roleName>, it is proper to say
            here in what manner it has been executed.</hi></p>
        <p><w rend="italics">As</w></p>
        <p>* <persName>Mr. <w rend="italics">West</w></persName> died the <date>10th of July, 1779</date>, at the ancient seat of the

            >Strickland</w> family</persName> in <placeName><w rend="italics">Kendal church</w></placeName>.—As he was a man of worth,
          as well as ingenuity, this further short memorial of his exit will not need an
          apology.</p>

      <p><hi rend="italics">As there is something particular, and often pleasing, in 
        the <roleName>author's</roleName>
            strokes of description and manner of thinking, care has been taken, all along, to
            preserve his ideas, as much as possible, in his own order, terms, and mode of
            construction. A few needless repetitions and redundancies have indeed been retrenched,
            but little has been added which was not necessary to complete the sense. On this
            account, as the work is in itself more of an useful than entertaining nature, it is
            presumed the judicious reader will not yet expect elegance of language, but be
            satisfied, if, on the whole, he find it decently perspicuous and correct.</hi></p>

          <w rend="smallcaps">Guide</w>, <hi rend="italics">it may be proper just to mention, that
            every care has been taken to correct the few inaccuraces that had slipped into the
            preceeding one, and to collect any additional matter which might tend to perfect the
            work. For this purpose a map of the lakes and the neighbouring country is given, as a
            particular, that may, on several accounts, be very acceptable to the <roleName>tourist</roleName>. As to</hi>
          views <hi rend="italics">of the lakes themselves, it has been judged most prudent not to
            enhance the price of the book, with aiming at what, on a small scale, cannot often
            convey an adequate representation. This province of amusement is best assigned to the

        <p>Having been of late years much frequented, and it being often suggested by those who have
          seen them, that views of the most striking features in this part of <placeName>England</placeName> would afford
          entertainment to the lovers of picturesque beauty, it is presumed the following proposal
          for the publication of six views will meet with approbation.</p>
        <list>
          <head>The SUBJECTS are as follow:</head>
          <label>1.</label>
          <item>A general view of <w rend="italics">Derwent-water</w>, and the vale of <w
              rend="italics">Keswick</w>, from <w rend="italics">Ashness</w>.</item>

        <p>The size of each plate will be 14½ inches by 10 inches. The price to subscribers will be

        <p>( x )</p>
        <p>half to be paid at the time of subscribing, the remainder on the delivery of the prints,
          which will be executed with as much expedition as the nature of the work will permit.</p>
        <p>Concise descriptions, in English and French, will also be given with the publication.</p>
        <p>In selecting these views of the Lakes, one principal endeavour of the artist, has been to
          choose those points where the peculiar distinction of each lake marks itself. In the
          vicinity of every lake there are a thousand romantic circumstances calculated for the
          pencil; but, in a limited work, it is supposed it will be most satisfactory to give such
          subjects as may fix in the memory of those who have visited the lakes the scenes they have
          viewed, and also afford a general idea of the appearance of the country, to others who may
          not have been in this part of <placeName>England</placeName>.</p>
        <p>After the first set is published (which will be about Christmas next) the proprietors
          mean to proceed with views of <hi rend="italics"><placeName>Windermere</placeName>, <placeName>Ulls-water</placeName></hi>, &amp;c. and
          the most remarkable features in their neighbourhoods; the drawings of which being already
          made, the work will be carried on with expedition, as the second set can in part be
          proceeding while the first set is executing.</p>

        <p>LAKES.</p>
        <p>SINCE persons of genius, taste, and observation began to make the tour of their own
          country, and to give such pleasing accounts of the natural history, and improving state of
          the northern parts of the kingdom, the spirit of visiting them has diffused itself among
          the curious of all ranks.</p>
        <p>Particularly, the taste for one branch of a noble art * (cherished under the protection
          of the greatest of kings and best of men) in which the genius of 
          <placeName><w rend="italics">Britain</w></placeName> rivals that of ancient <placeName><w rend="italics">Greece</w></placeName> and modern <placeName><w
            rend="italics">Rome</w></placeName>, induces many to visit the lakes of 
          <hi rend="italics"><placeName>Cumberland</placeName>, <placeName>Westmorland</placeName>,</hi> and <placeName><w rend="italics">Lancashire</w></placeName>; there to
          contemplate in <placeName>Alpine</placeName> scenery, finished in nature's highest tints, the pastoral and rural
          landscape, exhibited in all their stiles,</p>

        <p>the soft, the rude, the romantic, and the sublime; and of which perhaps like instances
          can no where be found assembled in so small a tract of country. What may be <w
            rend="italics">now</w> mentioned as another inducement to visit these natural beauties,
          is the goodness of the roads, which are much improved since <persName>Mr. <w rend="italics">Gray</w></persName>
          made his tour in <label><date>1765</date></label>, and <persName>Mr. <w rend="italics">Pennant</w></persName> his, in <label><date>1772</date></label>. The gentlemen
          of these counties have set a precedent worthy of imitation in the politest parts of the
          kingdom, by opening, at private expence, carriage roads for the ease and safety of such as
          visit the country; and the public roads are equally properly attended to. And if the
          entertainment at some of the inns be plain, it is accompanied with an easy charge,
          neatness, and attention. When the roads are more frequented, the inns may perhaps be more
          elegantly furnished and expensive; but the entertainment must remain much the same, as the
          viands at present are not excelled in any other quarter of the empire.</p>
        <p>The design of the following sheets, is to encourage the taste of visiting the lakes, by
          furnishing the c with a Guide; and for that purpose, the <roleName>writer</roleName> has here collected
            and laid before him, all the select stations and points of view, noticed by those <roleName>authors</roleName>
          who have last made the tour of the lakes, verified by his own repeated observations. He
          has also added remarks on the principal objects as they appear</p>
        <p>viewed</p>
        <pb n="22" facs="544.jp2"/>
        <p>THE LAKES. <seg type="pagenumber">3</seg></p>
        <p>viewed from different stations; and such other incidental information as he judged would
          greatly facilitate and heighten the pleasure of the tour, and relieve the 
         <roleName>traveller</roleName> from
          the burthen of those tedious enquiries on the road, or at the inns, which generally
          embarrass, and often mislead.</p>
        <p>The local knowledge here communicated, will not however injure, much less prevent the
          agreeable surprise that attends the first sight of scenes that surpass all description,
          and of objects which will always affect the spectator in the highest degree.</p>
        <p>Such as wish to unbend the mind from anxious cares, or fatiguing studies, will meet with
          agreeable relaxation in making the tour of the lakes. Something new will open itself at
          the turn of every mountain, and a succession of ideas will be supported by a perpetual
          change of objects, and a display of scenes behind scenes, in endless perspective. The <w
            rend="italics">contemplative</w> <roleName>traveller</roleName> will be charmed with the sight of the sweet
          retreats, that he will observe in thse enchanting regions of calm repose, and the <w
            rend="italics">fanciful</w> may figuratively review the hurry and bustle of busy life
          (in all its gradations) in the variety of unshaded rills that hang on the mountains sides,
          the hasty brooks that warble through the dell, or the mighty torrents precipitating
          themselves at</p>
        <p><seg type="pagesignature">B 2</seg> once</p>

        <p>once with thundering noise from tremendous, rocky heights; all pursuing one general end,
          their increase in the vale, and their union in the ocean.</p>
        <p>Such as spend their lives in cities, and their time in crouds will here meet with objects
          that will enlarge the mind, by contemplation, and raise it from nature to nature's first
          cause. Whoever takes a walk into these scenes must return penetrated with a sense of the
          creator's power in heaping mountains upon mountains, and enthroning rocks upon rocks. And
          such exhibitions of sublime and beautiful objects, cannot but excite at once both rapture
          and reverence.</p>
        <p>When exercise and change of air are recommended for health, the convalescent will find
          the latter here in the purest state, and the former will be the concomitant of the tour.
          The many hills and mountains of various heights, separated by narrow vales, through which
          the air is agitated and hurried on, by a multiplicity of brooks and mountain torrents,
          keep it in constant circulation, which is known to add much to its purity. The water is
          also as pure as the air, and on that account recommends itself to the valetudinarian.</p>
        <p>As there are few people, in easy circumstances, but may find a motive for visiting this
          extraordinary region, so more especially those who</p>
        <p>intend</p>
        <pb n="24" facs="546.jp2"/>
        <p>THE LAKES. <seg type="pagenumber">5</seg></p>
        <p>intend to make the continental tour should begin here; as it will give in miniature an
          idea of what they are to meet with there, in traversing the <placeName><w rend="italics">Alps</w></placeName> and
            <placeName><w rend="italics">Appenines</w></placeName>; to which our northern mountains are not inferior in
          beauty of line, or variety of summit, number of lakes, and transparency of water; not in
          colouring of rock, or softness of turf, but in height and extent only. The mountains here
          are all accessible to the summit, and furnish prospects no less surprising, and with more
          variety, than the <placeName><w rend="italics">Alps</w></placeName> themselves. The tops of the highest <placeName><w
            rend="italics">Alps</w></placeName> are inaccessible, being covered with everlasting snow, which
          commencing at regular heights above the cultivated tracts, or wooded and verdant sides,
          form indeed the highest contrast in nature. For there may be seen, all the variety of
          climate in one view. To this however we oppose the sight of the ocean from the summit of
          all the higher mountains as it appears intersected with promontories, decorated with
          islands, and animated with navigation; which adds greatly to the perfection and variety of
          all grand views.</p>
        <p>Those who have traversed the <placeName><w rend="italics">Alps</w></placeName>, visited the lake of <placeName><w
            rend="italics">Geneva</w></placeName>, and viewed <placeName>mount <w rend="italics">Blanc</w></placeName>, the highest of
          the <w rend="italics">Glaciers</w>, from <placeName>the valley of <w rend="italics">Chamouni</w></placeName>, in
            <placeName><w rend="italics">Savoy</w></placeName>, may still find entertainment in this domestic tour. To
          trace the analogy and differences of mountainous countries, furnishes the observant
          <roleName>traveller</roleName> with amusement; and the</p>
        <p><seg type="pagesignature">B 3</seg> travelled</p>

        <p>travelled visitor of <placeName>the <w rend="italics">Cumbrian</w> lakes and mountains</placeName>, will not be
          disappointed of pleasure in this particular.*</p>
        <p>This Guide will also be of use to the artist who may purpose to copy any of these views
          and landscapes, by directing his choice of station, and pointing out the principal
          objects. Yet it is not presumed positively to decide on these particulars, but only to
          suggest hints, that may be adopted, or rejected, at his pleasure.</p>
        <p>The late <persName>Mr. <w rend="italics">Gray</w></persName> was a great judge of landscapes, yet whoever
          makes choice of his station at the three mile stone from <placeName><w rend="italics">Lancaster</w></placeName>,
          on the <placeName><w rend="italics">Hornby</w></placeName> road, will fail in taking one of the finest afternoon
          rural views in <placeName><w rend="italics">England</w></placeName>. The station he points out is a quarter of a
          mile too low, and somewhat too much to the left. The more advantageous station, as I
          apprehend, is on the south fide of the great, or <placeName>Queens road</placeName>, a little higher</p>
        <p>than</p>
        <p>* In truth a more pleasing tour than these lakes hold out to men of leisure and curiosity
          cannot be devised. We penetrate the <w rend="italics">Glaciers</w>, traverse the <placeName><w
            rend="italics">Rhone</w></placeName> and the <placeName><w rend="italics">Rhine</w></placeName>, whilst our domestic lakes
          of <placeName><w rend="italics">Ulls-water</w></placeName>, <placeName><w rend="italics">Keswick</w></placeName>, and <placeName><w rend="italics"
            >Windermere</w></placeName>, exhibit scenes in so sublime a stile, with such beautiful colourings of
          rock, wood, and water, backed with so tremendous a disposition of mountains, that if they
          do not fairly take the lead of all the views of <placeName><w rend="italics">Europe</w></placeName>, yet they are
          indisputably such as no <persName>English traveller</persName> should leave behind him.</p>

        <p>than were <persName>Mr. <w rend="italics">Gray</w></persName> stood; for there the vale is in full display,
          including a longer reach of the river, and the wheel of <w rend="italics">Lune</w>,
          forming a high crowned isthmus, fringed with tall trees, that in time past was the

          nakedness of <placeName><w rend="italics">Caton-moor</w></placeName> on the right, and render the view
          complete.</p>
        <p>By company from the south, the lakes may be best visited by beginning with <placeName><w

            <p>Nothing but want of information could have prevented that <roleName>curious traveller</roleName> from visiting

        <p>all the lakes; * pointing out (what only can be described) the <w rend="italics"
            >permanent</w> features of each scene;—the vales, the dells, the groves, the hanging
          woods, the scattered cots, the deep mountains, the impending cliff, the broken ridge,
          &amp;c. Their <w rend="italics">accidental</w> beauties depend upon a variety of
          circumstances; light and shade, the air, the winds, the clouds, the situation with respect
          to objects, and the time of the day. For though the ruling tints be permanent, yet the
          green and gold of the meadow and vale, and the brown and purple of the mountain, the
          silver grey of the rock, and the azure hue of the cloud-topt pike, are frequently varied
          in appearance, by an intermixture of reflection from wandering clouds, or other bodies, or
          a sudden stream of sunshine that harmonizes all the parts anew. The pleasure therefore
          arising from such scenes is in some sort accidental.</p>
        <p>To render the tour more agreeable, the company should be provided with a telescope, for
          viewing the fronts and summits of inaccessible rocks, and the distant country, from the
          tops of the high mountains <placeName>Skiddaw</placeName> and <placeName>Helvellyn</placeName>. †</p>

        <p>The landscape mirror will also furnish much amusement, in this tour. Where the objects
          are great and near, it removes them to a due distance, and shews them in the soft colours
          of nature, and in the most regular perspective the eye can perceive, or science
          demonstrate.</p>
        <p>The mirror is of the greatest use in sunshine; and the person using it ought always to
          turn his back to the object that he views. It should be suspended by the upper part of the
          case, and the landscape will then be seen in the glass, by holding it a little to the
          right or left (as the position of the parts to be viewed require) and the face screened
          from the sun. A glass of four inches, or four inches and a half diameter is a proper
          size.</p>
        <p>The mirror is a plano-convex glass, and should be the segment of a large circle;
          otherwise dist-</p>

        <p>the reader will not lament, that our <roleName>author</roleName> has not any where attempted to delineate a
          view taken from either of these capital mountains, but rather wish he had shewn the same
          judgment of <w rend="italics">omission</w> in some other parts of his work. However, as an
          apology of the most persuasive kind for what may appear either prolix, or too
          high-coloured in some of the following descriptions, let it be here noted by the candid
          reader, at the <w rend="italics">out-set</w>, that the lakes were his favourite object,
          and on which he thought enough could scarce ever be said, and, that the seducing effects
          of an ardent passion, are, in any case, easier to discover in others, than to rectify in
          ourselves.</p>

        <p>ant and small objects are not perceived in it; but if the glass be too flat, the
          perspective view of great and near objects is less pleasing, as they are represented too
          near. These inconveniences may be provided against by two glasses of different convexity.
          The dark glass answers well in sunshine; but on cloudy and gloomy days the silver foil is
          the better.</p>

        <p>THE castle here is the first: object that attracts the attention of the
          <roleName>curious traveller</roleName>. The elevation of the site, and magnificence of the front, strike the
          imagination with the idea of a place of much strength, beauty, and importance; and such it
          has been ever since its foundation on the arrival of 
          the <trait type="ethnicity"><label rend="italics">Romans</label></trait> in
          these parts. An eminence of swift descent, that commands the fords of a great

            >Overborough</w></placeName>, by exploratory mounts (some of them still remaining) on the banks of
          the Lune, which also answered the purposes of guarding the fords of the river, and
          over-awing the natives. The mounts at <hi rend="italics"><placeName>Halton</placeName>, <placeName>Melling</placeName></hi>, and at the
          east end of the bridge of <w rend="italics">Lune</w>, near <placeName><w rend="italics">Hornby</w></placeName>,

          at <placeName><w rend="italics">Watercrook</w></placeName>, near <placeName><w rend="italics">Kendal</w></placeName>, by the
          intervention of the beacon on <placeName><w rend="italics">Warton-crag</w></placeName>, and the castellum on the

        <p>THE LAKES. <seg type="pagenumber">15</seg></p>
        <p>The present structure is generally supposed to have been built by <persName><w rend="italics"
            >Edward</w> III.</persName> but some parts of it seem to be of a higher date. There are three
          stiles of architecture very evident in the prefent castle. 1. Round towers, distant from
          each other about 26 paces, and joined by a wall and open gallery. On the western side,
          there remain two entire, and from their distance, and the visible foundation of others, it
          appears they have been in number seven, and that the form of the castle was then a
          polygon. One of these towers is called <hi rend="italics">Adrian's Tower</hi>, probably
          from something formerly standing there dedicated to that emperor. They are two stages
          high; the lights are narrow slits; the hanging gallery is supported by a single row of
          corbels, and the lower stages communicate by a close gallery in the wall. Each stage was
          vaulted with a plain pyramidal vault of great height. Those in the more southern towers
          are entire, and called <hi rend="italics"><persName>John of Gaunt</persName>'s ovens</hi>; but the calling them
          so, is as ridiculous as groundless.</p>
        <p><persName><w rend="italics">Taillebois</w>, Baron of <w rend="italics">Kendal</w></persName>, is the first
          after the conquest who was honoured with the command of this castle; and <persName><hi
            rend="italics">William de Taillebois</hi></persName>, in the reign of <persName><w rend="italics">Henry</w>
          II.</persName> obtained leave to take the surname of <persName><w rend="italics">Lancaster</w></persName>. It is therefore
          probable that the barons of <w rend="italics">Kendal</w> either built or repaired the
          ancient castle, in which they resided, until they erected, upon the summer site of the
          station</p>

        <p>of <w rend="italics">Concangium</w>, their castle at <placeName><w rend="italics">Kendal</w></placeName>; for
          the remains of some of the bastions <w rend="italics">there</w> agree in stile with the
          towers <w rend="italics">here</w>.</p>
        <p>2 The second distinct stile of building in <placeName><hi rend="italics">Lancaster Castle</hi></placeName>, is a
          square tower of great height, the lower part of which is of remote antiquity; the windows
          are small and round headed, ornanamented with plain short pillars on each side. The upper
          part of this magnificent tower is a modern repair; the masonry shews it; and a stone in
          the battlement, on the northern side, inscribed</p>
        <p>E. R.</p>
        <p><label><date>1585</date></label> R A.</p>
        <p>proves that the repair was made in the time of <persName>Queen <w rend="italics">Elizabeth</w></persName>. It
          is pretty evident that two towers, with the rampart, have been removed to give light and
          air to the lower windows on the outside of the great square tower; and it is joined by a
          wall of communication to <hi rend="italics">Adrian's Tower</hi>, that could not be there
          when the other two round towers were standing. There are two lesser square towers on the
          opposite side of the <w rend="italics">yard</w>, or <w rend="italics">court</w>.</p>
        <p>3.The third stile of building is the front or gateway. This may be given to <persName><w
            rend="italics">Edward</w> III.</persName> or to his son <persName><hi rend="italics">John of Gaunt</hi></persName>. It
          faces the east, and is a magnificent building in the gothic stile. It opens with a noble
          and lofty pointed arch, de-</p>

          of boultins. The intervals are pierced for the descent of missiles, and on each side rise
          two light watch-towers. Immediately over the gate, is an ornamented niche, which probably
          once contained the figure of the founder. On one side is still to be seen, on a shield, <placeName><w

        <p>On the north side of the hill, below the churchyard, are some remains of the wall that
          encompassed the station. It retains part of the ancient name of the place, being called <placeName><w

          satisfied it is not so, by viewing the part of the inclosure-wall yet standing, which is a
          thin mouldering fabric; whereas the <placeName><w rend="italics">Wery-wall</w></placeName>, is a cemented mass,
          that nothing but great violence can injure. Another fragment of it stands at the stile on

        <p>there was found, reversed in a bed of fine sand, above five feet under ground, a square
          inscribed stone, of four feet, by two and a half dimensions. A foot and two inches were
          broken off the lower corner on the right hand side, so as to render the inscription
          obscure, but the remaining letters were very evident, elegantly formed, square, and about
          three inches high. The inscription had consisted of eight or nine lines, of which six are
          entire, and of easy explanation; the loss in the seventh is readily supplied; but the
          eight must be made out by the common stile of such votive stones. The elegance of the
          characters pronounces them to be the work of the best times; but the two small letters in
          the third and fifth lines, reduce it to the age of <persName>the Emperor <w rend="italics"
            >Gordian</w></persName>; and if the three small letters have been occasioned by the omission of the
          sculptor, then it will be of higher antiquity. It is known by inscriptions found at <placeName><w

          entire lamp, with a turned up perforated handle to hang it by, the nozle of which was
          black from use. At the depth of two yards were likewise discovered a great number of human
          bones, with burnt ashes, a wall of great thickness, and a well filled with rubbish of the
          same kind, probably leading to a vault where other human remains were deposited; but the
          curious must for ever regret that no further search was made into its use and
          contents.</p>
        <p>What throws new light upon the station here, is the late discovery of a <trait type="ethnicity">

          considerable, may be supposed from the space discoloured with broken ware, the holes from
          whence the clay has been taken, and the great variety of bricks, tiles, and vessels that
          are found about them. But the greatest discovery is gathered from a tile with turned-up
          edges, impressed on each end with the words <hi rend="italics">Ale Sebusia</hi>, which
          points out a wing of cavalry not heard of before. The same inscription is found on bricks,

        <p>This town, ever since the conquest, has been renowned for loyalty and attachment to

            <w rend="italics">Northampton</w></persName>. <persName><w rend="italics">Charles</w> II.</persName> confirmed it, with
          additional privileges. But <placeName><w rend="italics">Lancaster</w></placeName> derived its greatest lustre and

          to the crown, in the contest with the house of <placeName><w rend="italics">York</w></placeName>. And so little
          had it retrieved itself when <persName><w rend="italics">Camden</w></persName> visited it, in 1609, that he

          with the turret on the change, will add much to the pleasing, or rather striking
          appearance this town has at a distance, on account of the castle, church, and the

          behind the altar, and the rest: of the church is further hurt by a multiplicity of pews.

          church-yard are extensive and pleasant, particularly the grand and much admired prospect
          of the northern mountains. The new chapel is a neat and convenient place of worship. There

          isles, cloathed with wood and sweet verdure. As you advance towards them, they seem to
          change their position, and hence often vary their appearance. At the same time a grand

        <p>At the side of the <placeName><w rend="italics">Eau</w></placeName>, † or river of the sands, a <roleName>guide</roleName> on
          horse-back, called <persName><hi rend="italics">the Carter</hi></persName> is in waiting to conduct passengers
          over the ford. The priory of <placeName><w rend="italics">Cartmel</w></placeName> was charged with this important
          office, and had synodals and peter-pence allowed towards its maintenance. Since the
          dis-</p>
        <p>solution</p>
        <p>nature of the plain on which he treads, cannot but suggest a series of ideas of a more
          sublime kind than those of rural elegance, and which will therefore gain a superior
          attention. The plain is then seemingly immense in extent, continued on in a dead level,
          and uniform in appearance. As he pursues his <w rend="italics">often-trackless</w> way he
          will recollect, that probably but a few hours before, the whole expanse was covered with
          some fathoms of water, and that in a few more it will as certainly be covered again. At
          the same time he may also perceive, on his left hand, the retreated ocean ready to obey
          the mysterious laws of its irresistable movement, without any visible barrier to stay it a
          moment where it is. These last considerations, though they may not be sufficient to alarm,
          must yet be able to rouse the mind to a state of more than ordinary attention; which
          co-operating with the other singular ideas of the prospect, must affect it in a very
          sublime and unusual manner. This the bare appearance of the <w rend="italics">sands</w>
          will do. But when the<roleName>traveller</roleName> 
          reaches the side of the <placeName><w rend="italics">Eau</w></placeName>, these

          a broad and seemingly impassable river, where the only remains he can perceive of ths
          surrounding lands are the tops of distant mountains, and where a solitary being on
          horseback (like some ancient genius of the deep) is descried hovering on its brink, or
          encountering its stream with gentle steps, in order to conduct him through it. When fairly
          entered into the water, if a stranger to this scene, and he do not feel himself touched

          there is really none at all; and the complacency which must naturally result from this
          consideration, will be heightened to an unusual degree, from observing, during his
          passage, the anxious and faithful instinct of his beast, and the friendly behaviour and
          aspect of his guide. All the fervours of grateful thankfulness will then be raised, and if
          with the usual perquisite to his venerable conductor, he can forget to convey his
          blessing, who would not conclude him to want one essential requisite for properly enjoying
          the tour of the lakes?</p>
        <p>Having crossed the river, the stranger <roleName>traveller</roleName> (whom we will suppose <hi rend="italics"
            >at length</hi> freed from any petty anxiety) will now have more inclination to survey
          the objects around him. The several particulars peculiar to an arm of the sea (as <hi
            rend="italics"><roleName>fisher-men</roleName>, ships, sea-fowl, shells, weeds</hi>, &amp;c.) will attract
          his notice, and new-model his reflections. But, if the sun shine forcibly, he will perhaps
          be most entertained with observing the little gay isles and promontories of land, that
          seem to hover in the air, or swim on a luminous vapour, that rises from the sand, and
          fluctuates beautifully on its surface.</p>
        <p>In short, on a fine summer day, a ride across this aestuary, (and that of <placeName><w

          elegant; but the painted glass is almost all destroyed. The preservation of this edifice

          the inside with a stucco ceiling. The choir and chancel he also repaired, suiting the new
          parts to the old remains of the canons seats, and thereby giving them their ancient
          uniform appearance. Persons uninformed of this always take it to be the same it was before
          the dissolution. The stile of the building, like most of its contemporaries, is irregular.
          The form is a cross, in length 157 feet; the transept 110 feet; the height of the walls 57
          feet. The tower on the centre, is of a singular construction, being a square within a
          square, the higher set at cross-angles with the lower. This gives it an odd appearance on
          all sides, but may have some reference to the otagonal pillars in the church, and both to
          the memory of something now forgotten. According to some accounts it was built and endowed

        <p>contemplative life, justifies the choice of the first settlers. Such a sequestered site,
          in the bottom of a deep dell, through which a hasty brook rolls its murmuring dream, and
          along which the roaring west wind would often blow, joined with the deep-toned mattin
          fong, must have been very favourable to the solemn melancholy of monastic life.</p>
        <p>To prevent surprise, and call in assistance, a beacon was placed on the crown of an
          eminence, that rises immediately from the abbey, and is seen over all <placeName><w rend="italics"
            >Low-Furness</w></placeName>. The door leading to the beacon is still remaining in the inclosure
          wall, on the eastern side. The magnitude of the abbey may be known from the dimensions of
          the ruins; and enough is standing to shew the stile of the architecture. The round and
          pointed arches occur in the doors and windows. The fine clustered Gothic, and the heavy
          plain <trait type="ethnicity">
            <label>Saxon</label>
          </trait> pillars, stand contrasted. The walls shew excellent masonry; are in many
          places counter-arched, and the ruins discover a strong cement. The east window has been
          noble, and some of the painted glass that once adorned it, is preserved in a window in <placeName><w

            >Maud</w> his Queen</persName>; both crowned, and well executed. In the south wall, and east end of

          high mass. In the middle space, where the first barons of <placeName><w rend="italics">Kendal</w></placeName> are
          interred, lies a procumbent figure of a man in armour, cross legged. The chapter-house has
          been a noble room of sixty feet by forty five. The vaulted roof, formed of twelve ribbed
          arches, was supported by six pillars in two rows, at thirteen feet distance from each
          other. Now, supposing each of the pillars to be two feet in diameter, the room would be
          divided into three alleys, or passages, each thirteen feet wide. On entrance, the middle
          one only could be seen, lighted by a pair of tall pointed windows at the upper end of the
          room; the company in the side passage would be concealed by the pillars, and the vaulted
          roof, that groined from those pillars, would have a truly gothic disproportioned
          appearance of sixty feet by thirteen. The two side alleys were lighted each by a pair of
          similar lights, besides another pair at the upper end, at present entire, and which
          illustrate what is here said. Thus, whilst the upper end of the room had a profusion of
          light, the lower end would be in the shade. The noble roof of this singular edifice did
          but lately fall in, and the entrance or porch is still standing; a fine circular arch,
          beautified with a deep cornice and a portico on each side. The only entire roof now

        <p>There is a general disproportion remarkable in gothic churches, which must have
          originated in some effect intended by all the architects. Perhaps to strike the mind with
          reverential awe at the sight of magnificence, arising from the vastness of two dimensions,
          and a third seemingly disregarded. Or, perhaps such a determinate height and length was
          found more favourable than any other to the church song, by giving a deeper swell to the
          choir of chaunting <roleName>monks</roleName>. A remarkable deformity in this edifice, and for which there is
          no apparent reason or necessity, is, that the north door, which is the principal entrance,
          is on one side of the window above it. The tower has been supported by four magnificent
          arches, of which only one remains entire. They rested upon four tall pillars, whereof
          three are finely cluttered, but the fourth is of a plain unmeaning construction.</p>

        <p>the judicious management of these assemblages, the late owner performed wonders.
          Consulting the genius of the place, he called in to aid his plan, and harmonized to his
          little spot, the features of a country vast in extent, and by nature highly picturesque,*
          whose distant parts agreeing with what was immediately near him, form a most magnificent
          whole. For, besides the ornamental grounds, the views from the house are both pleasing and
          surprising. They are at once grand and elegant, rural and marine. On the eastern side you
          have a fine aestuary, spotted with rocks, isles, and peninsulas, a variety of shore,
          deeply indented in some places, in others composed of noble arched rocks, craggy, broken,
          and fringed with wood;—over these, hanging woods, intermixed with cultivated inclosures,
          covered with a back ground of stupendous mountains. As a contrast to this view, from the
          other end of the gravel walk, (between two culminating hills covered with tall wood) is
          seen, in fine perspective, a rich cultivated dale, divided by hedge-row trees; beyond
          these, hanging grounds cut into inclosures, with scattered farms, and above them all, a
          long range of waving pasture ground and sheep walks, shining in variety of vegetation.
          This sweet pastoral picture is much heightened by the deep shade of the towering wooded
          hills, between which it is viewed. Turn to the left, the</p>

        <p>scenery is all reversed. Under a range of tall sycamores, an expanse of water bursts upon
          the eye, and beyond it, land just visible through the azure mist. Vessels traversing this
          bay are also seen in a most picturesque manner, and, from the lower part of the house,
          appear failing through the trees and approaching it till they drop anchor just under the
          windows. The range of sycamores has a fine effect in this sea view by breaking the line in
          the watery plane, and forming an elegant frame to a very excellent picture. By turning a
          little to the right the prospect changes. At the head of a sloping inclosure, and under
          the skirts of a steep wood, <placeName>a sequestered cottage</placeName> stands in the nicest point of
          beauty.</p>
        <p>There is a great variety of pleasing views from the different meandering walks and seats

          where <placeName><w rend="italics">Ulverston</w></placeName> and the environs make a pretty picture. From under
          the shrubbery (on the eastern side of the house, and from the gate at the north end of the
          walk, behind a swell of green hills) if the afternoon sun shine, the conical summits of
          distant mountains are seen glistening like burnished gold, and pointing to the heavens in

        <p>the upper end <placeName>a snow-white house</placeName> is seen, under a hanging wood, and to the N. E. the lake
          seems to wind round the mountain's feet. The whole range of <placeName><w rend="italics">Coniston</w>
          fells</placeName> is now in sight, and under them a lower sweep of dark rocks frown over the crystal
          surface of the lake. Advancing, on the left, see <placeName><w rend="italics">Lowick-hall</w></placeName>, once
          the seat of a family of that name. Behind this, a dismal scene of barrenness presents
          itself; clustered grey rocky mountains, variegated with some few stripes of heath. After
          crossing the outlet of the lake, at <placeName><w rend="italics">Lowick-bridge</w></placeName>, these dreary
          objects are found often intercepted by pieces of arable ground, hanging sweetly to the
          east, and cut into waving inclosures, with cottages prettily situated under ancient oaks,
          or venerable yews. <placeName>The white houses</placeName>, in these parts, covered with blue slate, have a neat
          appearance. The <w rend="italics">thatched</w> cot is esteemed a more picturesque object;
          yet the other kind, seen under a deep green wood, or covered by a purple back-ground of

          sides, forming between their curvatures, a variety of pretty bays. The whole length of the

          frequently indented, and one pretty bay opens after another in a variety of forms.</p>
        <p>STATION I. A little above <placeName>the village of <w rend="italics">Nibthwaite</w></placeName>, the lake opens
          in full view. From the rock, on the left of the road, you have a general prospect of the
          lake upwards. This station is found by observing where you have a hanging rock over the
          road, on the east, and an ash-tree on the west side of the road. On the opposite shore, to
          the left, and close by the water's edge, are some stripes of meadow and green ground, cut
          into small inclosures, with some <placeName>dark coloured houses</placeName>, under aged yew trees. Two
          promontories project a great way into the lake; the broadest is finely terminated by steep
          rocks, and crowned with wood; and both are insulated when the lake is high. Upwards, over
          a fine sheet of water, the lake is again intersected by a far-projecting promontory, that
          swells into two eminences, and betwixt them the lake is again caught, with some white
          houses at the feet of the mountains. And more to the right, over another headland, you
          catch a fourth view of the lake, twisting to the N. E. Almost opposite to this station,
          stands a house on the crown of a rock, covered with ancient trees, that has a most
          romantic appearance.</p>

        <p>The noble scenery increases as you ride along the banks. In some places, bold rocks,
          (lately covered with woods) conceal the lake entirely, and when the winds blow, the
          beating of surges is heard just under you. In other places, abrupt openings shew the lake
          anew, and there, when calm, its limpid surface, shining like a crystal mirror, reflects
          the azure sky, or its dappled clouds, in the finest mixture of nature's clare-obscure. On
          the western side the shore is more variegated with small inclosures, scattered cots,
          groves, and meadows.</p>
        <p>The road continues along the eastern banks of the lake; here bare, there sweetly fringed
          with a few tall trees, the small remains of its ancient woods, that till lately cloathed
          the whole.</p>
        <p>STATION II. When you are opposite to the peninsula last described, proceed through a gate
          on the left hand, and from the rocky eminence you have a general view of the lake both
          ways. To the south, a sweet bay is formed between the horns of two peninsulas, and beyond
          that a fine sheet of water appears, terminated by the promontories which form the straits,
          through which the lake has its outlet. From thence, the coast is beautifully diversified
          by a number of green eminences, crowned with wood; and <placeName>sequestered cottages</placeName>, interspersed
          amongst them, half concealed by yew trees, and, above them, a</p>

        <p>wave of rocky spiral mountains, dressed in brown vegetation, form the most romantic
          scenes. Between this and a wooded eminence, a green hill, cut into inclosures to the very
          top, in some parts patched with rock and little groves, has a beautiful appearance;
          especially when contrasted with the barren scenes on one hand, and the deep shade of a
          waving wood on the other. At the foot of this cultivated tract, and on the margin of the
          lake, a few white houses, partly concealed in a grove, look like enchanted seats on fairy
          ground. Behind these, a barren bleak mountain frowns in sullen majesty, and down his
          furrowed side <placeName>the <w rend="italics">Black-beck</w> of <w rend="italics">Torver</w></placeName> rolls
          its fretted torrent. Just at your feet lies the oblong rocky <placeName>isle of <w rend="italics"
            >Peel</w></placeName>; and near it the dark points of half immersed rocks just shew themselves by
          turns. Here is the finest picture of the lake, and when it is smooth, the whole is seen
          reflected on the shining surface of the watery mirror. On the western side, the coast is
          deep rocks. The eastern side is much embayed. The high end of the lake is here in view,
          yet it seems to wind both ways behind the opposite promontories. The range of naked rocks,
          that cross the head of the lake, appear now awful from their fable hue, and behind them
          the immense mass of <hi rend="italics">Cove, <placeName>Rydal-head</placeName></hi>, and many nameless mountains,
          have a most stupendous appearance, and seeming inaccessible height. A succession of pretty
          bays open to the <roleName>traveller</roleName> as he advances; the banks become more wooded,</p>

          village of the same name. The hall has only changed masters twice since the conquest, and
          has belonged to <persName>the family of <w rend="italics">Fleming</w></persName> most of the time.</p>
        <p>STATION III. After crossing the common, where grows a picturesque yew tree on the right
          hand, and a small peninsula rushes into the lake, on the left, crowned with a single tree,
          enter the grove and pass a gate and bridge that crosses a small rivulet.—Look for a
          fragment of dark coloured rock on the margin of the water, and near it will be found the
          best stand for the artist to take the finest view on the lake. Looking across the lake, by
          the south end of the grove that conceals <placeName><w rend="italics">Coniston-hall</w></placeName>, and over the
          cultivated tract that rises behind it, between two swells of rocks, a cataract will meet
          the eye, issuing from the bosom of the mountains. The side ground, on the right, is a
          wooded, sloping rock, and over it the road is catched slanting along. The near fore-ground
          is the greatest extent of the lake; and behind the immediate mountains, the <placeName><w
            rend="italics">Westmorland</w></placeName> fells are seen towering to the clouds. This station will
          be found by company coming down the lake, at the circular bay, where the road first joins
          the level of the water.</p>

        <p>The next grand view is had in the boat, and from the centre of the lake, opposite to <placeName><w
            rend="italics">Coniston-hall</w></placeName>. Looking towards the mountains, the lake spreads itself
          into a noble expanse of transparent water, and bursts into a bay on each side, bordered
          with verdant meadows, and inclosed with a variety of grounds rising in an exceedingly bold
          manner. The objects are beautifully diversified amongst themselves, and contrasted by the
          finest exhibition of rural elegance, cultivation, and pasturage, waving woods, and sloping
          inclosures, adorned by nature, and improved by art, under the bold sides of stupendous
          mountains, whose airy summits, the elevated eye cannot now reach, and which almost deny
          access to the human kind.</p>
        <p>Following the line of shore from <w rend="italics">Coniston-hall</w> to the upper end of
          the lake, <placeName>the village of <w rend="italics">Coniston</w></placeName> is in full view, and consists of
          seats, groups of houses, farms, and cots, scattered in a picturesque manner over the
          cultivated slope. Some are snow white, others grey; some stand forth on bold eminences at
          the head of green inclosures, backed with steep woods; others are pitched on swift
          declivities, and seem hanging in the air; some again are on a level with the lake; and all
          are neatly covered with blue slate, the produce of the mountains, and beautified with
          ornamental yews, hollies, and tall pines, or firs. This is a charming scene, when the
          morning sun gilds the whole with a variety of tints. In the point of</p>

        <p>beauty and centre of perspective, a white house, under a hanging wood gives, life to this
          picture. Here a range of dark rugged rocks rise abruptly, and deeply contrast the
          transparent surface of the lake, and the stripe of verdure that skirts their feet. The
          eastern shore is not less bold and embayed.*</p>
        <p>It will be allowed, that the views on this lake are beautiful and picturesque, yet they
          please more than surprise. The hills that immediately inclose the lake are ornamental, but
          humble. The mountains at the head of the lake are great, noble, and sublime, without any
          thing that is horrid or terrible. They are bold and steep without the projecting
          precipice, the overhanging rock, or pendent cliff. The hanging woods, waving inclosures,
          and airy sites, are elegant, beautiful, and picturesque; and the whole may be seen with
          ease and pleasure. In a fine morning there is not a more pleasant rural ride; and then the
          beauties of the lake are seen to the most advantage. In the afternoon, if the sun shine,
          much of the effect is lost by the change of light; and such as visit it from the north
          lose all the charms arising from the swell of the mountains, by turning their backs upon
          them.</p>

          on the western canton, in a clear stream, concealed by its banks. The lake bends away to

          with a cot set under a full-topt tree.</p>

          far into the lake, finely elevated, crowned with cultivation, and bordered with fringed
          trees and coppice wood. The lake is encompassed with a good carriage road, and over its
          outlet is a narrow stone bridge. On the banks are villages and scattered houses, sweetly
          situated under woods, and hanging grounds, enamelled with delightful verdure, and soft
          vegetation; all which is heightened by the deep shade of the woods, and the strong

          shrubs, and coarse vegetation, intermixed with grey rocks, that group finely with the deep
          green of yews and hollies. The eastern view is a noble contrast to this, adorned with all
          that is beautiful, grand, and sublime. The immediate shore is much cultivated. The variety
          of hanging grounds are immense, consisting of woods, groves, and inclosures, all
          terminating in rocky uplands of various forms. It spreads out above in a beautiful variety
          of waving inclosures, intermixed with hanging woods, and shrubby circular spots,
          over-topped with wild grounds, and rocky ridges of broken mountains. In some places it
          swells into spacious bays, fringed with trees, whose bushy heads wave beautifully over the
          crystal waters. The parsonage house is seen sweetly seated under a range of tall firs.
          Following the same line of shore, above the east ferry point, and on the banks of the bay,

        <p>abuse for executing it to his own fancy. The want of choice might justify his having a
          garden on the island; but, since it is now in his power to have it elsewhere, I hope it
          will be his pleasure, when he re-visits the place, to restore the island to its native
          state of pastoral simplicity, and rural elegance, by its removal. *</p>
        <p>This</p>
            <p>* Our <roleName>author</roleName> seems, with <persName>Mr. <w rend="italics">Hutchinson</w></persName>, to have had no good will
          to <persName>Mr. <w rend="italics">English</w></persName>'s garden. But I query whether their censures be
          critically just. In the first place, it does not appear, that the owner considered this
          inclosure as a specimen of his taste; where then is the propriety of judging it by the
          principles of taste? If this be right, those who make the tour of the lakes will find
          little but blemishes in most of the rural habitations they may see in landscapes, and
          which are often greatly praised. For there can be but a very few of them where a moderate
          fancy could not tell how to make them <w rend="italics">better</w>. Most probably the
          proprietor of the garden, like the founders of most country cottages, considered use as
          the chief object in its formation; and if so, by that test it should principally be tried.
          But as an <hi rend="italics">object meerly</hi>, seen from the shore of the lake, <persName>Mr. <w
            rend="italics">Hutchinson</w></persName> tells us, it is <w rend="italics">disgusting</w>. If I may
          judge of other people's unbiassed notions by my own, I believe very few will concur with
          this decision. On the contrary, I believe it will attract the eye more than most other
          objects then in sight; and that not on account of its deformity, but from the inherent
          principles of taste. In the midst of simple <hi rend="italics">variegated nature, formal
            works of art</hi> have often the most pleasing effect. They please from contrast in <w
            rend="italics">form</w> and <w rend="italics">colour</w>, and also from our being
          accustomed to see them in such situations. For the works of men's hands have always been
          found amongst the works of nature. We may be pleased, indeed, with the beauties of of an
          intermixture of wood and lawn, but we must be better pleased, when they are</p>

        <p>If this be not true, the chief reasons for raising objects of <w rend="italics"
            >masonry</w> on proper sites (attempted to be recommended in Article VIII. of the <w

          find them, with respect to the objects amongst which they stand, yet I cannot but think
          them a considerable accession to the beauties of the lake. And could one with a wish throw
          a bridge from shore to shore, place the uncommon row of houses near <placeName><w rend="italics"
            >Shap</w></placeName> across the island, or even conjure a city upon it, I should persuade myself
          (however it might vary the <w rend="italics">character</w>, or deviate from certain
          limited and rigid conceptions of rural elegance) that, beautiful as the prospects of this
          lake certainly are, there is no eye but would then dwell upon them with more pleasure than
          it possibly can do at present. It might then become a rival to the celebrated <placeName>lake of <w

          its having a city at one end, and being surrounded with palaces.—Indeed I presume it will
          not be easy to point out an instance of natural beauty of any kind, which would not

          extent of water, bounded in front by waves of distant mountains, that rise from the
          water's edge. The two ferry points form a picturefque strait; and beyond that, the <placeName><w

          other, shooting far into the lake, form a grand sinuosity, while the intermediate shores
          are beautifully indented with wooded promontories, or ornamented with elegant edgings of
          luxuriant trees. <placeName><w rend="italics">Berkshire</w></placeName>, and <placeName><w rend="italics">Crow-holme</w></placeName>
          islands break the line in this noble expanse of water. The eastern shore discovers much
          cultivation; and the succeeding hills are much diversified, and strangely tumbled about.
          Some are laid out in grass inclosures, others cut with hedges, and fringed with trees; one
          is crowned with wood, and skirted with the sweetest verdure; another waves with corn, and
          the whole is a mixture of objects that constitute the most pleasing of rural scenes—The

          shore, patched with islands, and the whole encirded by an amphitheatre of distant hills,

          interrupted with scattered islands of different figure and dress; which on a calm day may
          be seen distinctly reflected from the limpid surface of the water that surrounds them. The

            >Rosa</w></persName> invented. The island is the centre of this amphitheatre, and in the opposite
          point, directly over the extremity of the lake, is <placeName><w rend="italics">Rydal-hall</w></placeName>,
          sweetly seated for the enjoyment of these scenes, and animating the whole in return. The

          mentioned below, have probably given rise to a report, which has long prevailed, that the
          house is haunted. And many are the stories of frightful visions, and mischievous deeds,
          which the <roleName>goblins</roleName> of the place are said to have performed, to terrify and distress the
          harmless neighbourhood. These fables are not yet entirely disbelieved. <roleName>Spectres</roleName> still are
          seen, and there are two human skulls, which have lain in the window of a large room as
          long as can be remembered, whose history and reputed properties, are too singular not to
          contribute something to this story of the <placeName><hi rend="italics">haunted house</hi></placeName>, and to
          let them be passed over in this note.</p>
        <p>It has been a popular tale in these parts, of immemorial standing, that these skulls
          formerly belonged to two<roleName>poor old people</roleName>, who were unjustly executed for a robbery; that,
          to perpetuate their innocence, some<roleName>ghost</roleName> brought them there, and that they are for that
          end <w rend="italics">indistructible</w>, and, in effect, <w rend="italics"
          >immoveable</w>. For, it is said, to what place soever they were taken, or however used,
          they were still presently seen again in their old dormitory, the window. As the report
          goes, they have been buried, burnt, powdered, and dispersed in the winds, and upon the
          lake, several times to no purpose, as to their removal or destruction. So far says common
          fame. Certain it is these human remains still exist. And it would be thought an
          impeachment of the taste and curiosity of the<roleName>nymphs</roleName> and swains of the neighbouring
          villages, if they could not say they had once seen the skulls of <placeName><w rend="italics"

          ferry-house seen under the sycamore grove, has a fine effect; and the broken cliff over
          it, constitutes a most agreeable picture. The greatest beauty of shore. and the finest
          rural scenes in nature, are found by traversing the lake; and viewing each in turn, they

          with this singular notice. But be their origin what it may, their legend is too whimsical

          of this wonderful picture, I will just give the particulars of which it consists.</p>

          boundary of the lake, and the situation high enough to look <w rend="italics">down</w>

          In landscapes you are either on a level with the objects, or look up to them; the painter
          cannot give the declivity at your feet, which lessens the object as much in the

          slopes of cultivated inclosures, adorned in the sweetest manner with every object that can
          give variety to art, or elegance to nature; trees, woods, villages, houses, farms,
          scattered with picturesque confusion, and waving to the eye in the most romantic
          landscapes that nature can exhibit.</p>
        <p>"This valley, so beautifully inclosed, is floated by the lake, which spreads forth to the
          right and left, in one vast, but irregular expanse of transparent water; a more noble
          object can hardly be imagined. Its immediate shore is traced in every variety of line that
          fancy can imagine; sometimes contracting the lake into the appearance of a noble winding
          river; at others retiring from it, and opening into large bays, as if for navies to anchor
          in; promontories spread with woods, or scattered with trees and inclosures, projecting
          into the water in the most picturesque stile imaginable; rocky points breaking the shore,
          and rearing their bold heads above the water; in a word, a variety that amazes the

          which rises from the water in the most picturesque inequalities of surface: High land in
          one place, low in another, clumps of trees in this spot, scattered ones in that, adorned
          by a farm-house on the water's edge, and backed with a little wood, vying in simple
          elegance with Baromean palaces: Some of the smaller isles rising from the lake, like
          little hills of wood; some only scattered with trees, and others of grass of the finest

          judgment, and it is evident he gives the preference to <placeName><w rend="italics">Windermere</w></placeName>. *
          Yet this ought not to prejudice the minds of those who have the tour to make, against such

        <p>The fish of this lake are char, trout, perch, pike, and eel. Of the char there are two

          the latter is a fish that did not spawn the last season, and is on that account more

          of them to the vale, that make the mountains tremble to their fall. The hollow noise
          swells and dies upon the ear by turns. The scenes are astonishing, and the succession of
          them match-less. At <placeName><w rend="italics">Rydal-hall</w></placeName> are two cascades worthy of notice.
          One is a little above the house, to which <persName>Sir <hi rend="italics">Michael le Fleming</hi></persName>

        <p>ruptedly from an immense height of rock, into the rocky bason below, shaking the mountain
          under you with its fall, and the air above with the rebound. It is a surprising scene.
          This gentleman's example in opening a road to the fall, recommends itself strongly to
          others of this country, which abounds with so many noble objects of curiosity, and which
          all <roleName>travellers</roleName> of the least taste would visit with pleasure, could they do it with
          convenience and safety.</p>
        <p>The other cascade is a small fall of water seen through the window of the summer-house,
          in <persName>Sir <w rend="italics">Michael</w></persName>'s orchard. The first who brought this sweet scene to

          as no one describes these views better than <persName>Mr. <w rend="italics">Mason</w></persName>, the reader
          shall have the account of it in his own words. "Here nature has performed every thing in
          little that she usually executes in her larger scale; and on that account, like the

          little fragment of a rock thrown into the bason, not a single stem of brush-wood that
          starts from its craggy sides, but has a picturesque meaning; and the little central
          current dashing down a cleft of the darkest coloured stone, produces an effect of light
          and shadow beautiful beyond description. This little theatrical scene might be painted as

        <p>the stone-wall on the right hand, a few steps leading to a soft green knoll, and from its
          crown, you have the finest view of the vale, the lake, and their environs. The island is
          near the centre, unless the water be very low. Its margin is graced with a few scattered
          trees, and an embowered hut. The church stands at a small distance from the lake, on the

          of four miles, encreased by a variety of pastoral torrents, that pour their silver streams
          down the mountains sides, and, then warbling join the lake. The range of mountains on the

          margin of the lake. The opposite shore is beautified with a variety of crown-topp'd rocks,
          some rent, some wooded, others not, rising immediately from, or hanging towards the water;
          and all set off with a back-ground of verdant mountains, rising in the noblest pastoral
          stile. Its singular beauty is its being almost intersected in the middle by two
          peninsulas, that are joined by a bridge, in a taste suitable to the genius of the place,
          which serves for an easy communication among the <roleName>shepherds</roleName>, that dwell on the opposite

        <p>At the sixth mile-post, from the top of an eminence, on the left, there is a good general

          islands, dressed with wood, and charmingly placed. The lake terminates sweetly with a
          pyramidal rock, wooded to the top; and opposite to it, a silver-grey rock, hanging over
          its base towards the lake, has a fine effect.</p>
        <p>The road after this leads through the narrow green <placeName>vale of <w rend="italics"

          of the lake however appears more extended from its bosom, than from its banks. I shall
          therefore point out the favourite stations round the lake, that have often been
          verified.</p>
        <p>STATION I. <placeName><w rend="italics">Cockshut-hill</w></placeName> is remarkable for a general view. It is
          covered with a motly mixture of young wood; has an easy ascent to the top, and from it the
          lake appears in great beauty. On the floor of a spacious amphitheatre, of the most
          picturesque mountains imaginable, an elegant sheet of water is spread out before you,
          shining like a mirror, and transparent as chrystal; variegated with islands adorned with
          wood, or cloathed with the sweetest verdure, that rise in the most pleasing forms above
          the watery plane. The effects all around are amazingly great; but no words can describe
          the surprising pleasure of this scene, on a fine day, when the sun plays upon the bosom of
          the lake, and the surrounding mountains are illuminated by his refulgent rays, and their
          rocky broken summits invertedly reflected by the surface of the water.</p>
        <p>STATION II. The next celebrated station is at a small distance, named <placeName><w rend="italics"
            >Crow-park</w></placeName>, which contained, till of late, a grove of oaks of immemorial growth,
          whose fall <persName>the bard of <w rend="italics">Lowes-water</w></persName> thus bemoans in humble plaintive

          <l>—That ancient wood, where beasts did safely rest,</l>
          <l>And where the crow long time had built her nest,</l>
          <l>Now falls a destin'd prey to savage hands,</l>
          <l>Being doom'd, alas! to visit distant lands.</l>
          <l>Ah! what avails thy boasted strength at last?</l>
          <l>That brav'd the rage of many a furious blast;</l>

        </lg>
        <p>This now shadeless pasture, is a gentle eminence not too high on the very margin of the
          lake, which it commands in all its extent, and looks full into the craggy pass of <placeName><w
            rend="italics">Borrowdale</w></placeName>. Of this station <persName>Mr. <w rend="italics">Gray</w></persName> speaks
          thus. "<label><date>October 4th</date></label>, I walked to <placeName><w rend="italics">Crow-park</w></placeName>, now a rough pasture, once
          a glade of ancient oaks, whose large roots still remain in the ground, but nothing has
          sprung from them. If one single tree had remained, this would have been an unparalleled
          spot; and <persName><w rend="italics">Smith</w></persName> judged right when he took his print of the lake from
          hence, for it is a gentle eminence not too high, on the very margin of the water, and
          commands it from end to end, looking full into the gorge of <placeName><w rend="italics"
            >Borrowdale</w></placeName>. I prefer it even to <placeName><w rend="italics">Cockshut-hill</w></placeName>, which lies

        <p>STATION III. A third station, on this side, will be found by keeping along the line of

            >Wallow-crag</w></placeName> directly over you on the left; then, without the gate, on the edge of
          the common, observe two huge fragments of ferruginous coloured rock, pitched into the side
          of the mountain by their descent. Here all that is great and pleasing on the lake, all
          that is grand and sublime in the environs, lie before you in a beautiful order, and
          natural disposition. Looking down upon the water, the four large islands appear distinctly
          over the peninsula of <placeName><w rend="italics">Stable-hills</w></placeName>. <placeName><w rend="italics"
            >Lord's-island</w></placeName> richly dressed in wood. A little to the left <placeName><w rend="italics"

            >Ramps-holme</w></placeName> is catched in a line betwixt that and <placeName>St. <w rend="italics"
            >Herbert's-island</w></placeName>, which traverses the lake in an oblique direction, and has a fine
          effect. These are the four most considerable islands on the lake. Under <placeName><w rend="italics"

          picture to the artist, and to give the most pleasure and entertainment to the company who
          make the tour, the <roleName>author</roleName> has taken all possible care to secure these ends in his choice

            >Herbert's-island</w></placeName>, has a similar effect. All idea of river or outlet is here
          excluded; but, over a neck of undulated land finely scattered with trees, distant water is
          just seen behind <placeName><w rend="italics">Lord's-island</w></placeName>. The white church of <placeName><w

        <p>their permanency, and that is, the annual fall of timber and coppice-wood, and the
          frequent removal of the picturesque trees, which take place on the borders of the lakes.
          These accidents, however, as they cannot be prevented, must be allowed for by the candid
          <roleName>traveller</roleName>, where he finds the original differing in these respects from the account given
          of it in the book.</p>
        <p>The fall of <placeName><w rend="italics">Crow-park</w></placeName>, on <placeName><w rend="italics">Derwent-water</w></placeName>, has
          long been regretted. And the present fall of <persName>Lord <w rend="italics">Egr—m—t</w></persName>'s woods
          has denudated a considerable part of the western border of the lake. Nor is <persName>Mr. <w

          above-mentioned, to be now verified. And alas! the waving woods of <placeName><w rend="italics"
            >Barrow-side</w></placeName>, and <placeName><w rend="italics">Barrow-gill</w></placeName>, are no more.</p>
        <p>It is true, that the painter, by the creative power of his pencil, can supply such
          deficiences in the features of his landscape; but the plastic power of nature, or the
          careful hand of industry, directed by taste and judgment, can only make up such losses to
          the visitors of the lakes.</p>
        <p>Thus much was thought proper to be subjoined in this place, as an apology, once for all,
          for the casual differences of this kind, that may be found between the descriptions given
          of these lakes in this manual, and their real appearance at any future time.</p>

          shore is bounded by a range of hills, down to the entrance of <placeName><w rend="italics"

            rend="italics">Skiddaw</w></placeName>. Their skirts descend in gentle slopes, and end in cultivated
          grounds. The whole of the western coast is beautiful beyond what words can express, and
          the north end exhibits what is most gentle and pleasing in landscape. The southern
          extremity of the lake, is a violent contrast to all this. <placeName><w rend="italics"
            >Falcon-crag</w></placeName>, an immense rock hangs over your head, and upwards, a forest of broken
          pointed rocks in a semicircular sweep, towering inward, form the most horrid amphitheatre
          that ever eye beheld in the wild forms of convulsed nature. The immediate margin of the
          lake, is, however, a sweet variegated shore of meadow and pasture, up to the foot of the
          rocks. Over a border of hedge-row trees, <placeName><w rend="italics">Lowdore-house</w></placeName> is seen,
          under <placeName><hi rend="italics">Hallow-stone crag</hi></placeName>, a sloping rock, whose back is covered
          with soft vegetation. Beyond it appear the awful craggy rocks that conceal the pass into
            <placeName><w rend="italics">Borrowdale</w></placeName>, and at their feet a stripe of verdant meadow, through
          which the <placeName><w rend="italics">Derwent</w></placeName> serpentizes to the lake in silence.</p>
        <p>The road is along <placeName><w rend="italics">Barrowside</w></placeName> on the margin of the lake, narrow, yet

          trimmed with trees that hang from its numerous fissures. Above this is seen a towering
          grey rock rising majestically rude, and near it <placeName><w rend="italics">Shuttenoer</w></placeName>, a spiral
          rock, not less in height, and hanging more forward over its base. Betwixt these, an awful
          chasm is formed, through which the waters of <placeName><w rend="italics">Watanlath</w></placeName> are hurled.
          This is the Niagara of the lake, the renowned cataract of <placeName><w rend="italics">Lowdore</w></placeName>. *
          To see this, ascend to an opening in the grove, directly above the mill. It is the
          misfortune of this celebrated water-fall to fail entirely in a dry season. The wonderful

        <p>On the summit of <placeName><w rend="italics">Castle-crag</w></placeName> are the remains of a fort; and much
          freestone, both red and white, has been quarried out oft he ruins. Lately a lead pan with
          an iron bow was taken out of them, and six years since two masses of smelted iron, which
          probably were from the bloomery at the foot of the <w rend="italics">Stake</w> in <placeName><w
            rend="italics">Borrowdale</w></placeName>. The fort has most likely been of <trait type="ethnicity"><label>Roman</label></trait> origin, to guard

          and after them the <roleName><w rend="italics">Furness</w> monks</roleName>, maintained this fort for the same

          the pass of <placeName><w rend="italics">Borrowdale</w></placeName> is distinctly seen, every bend of the river
          till it joins the lake; the lake itself, spotted with islands; the most extraordinary line
          of shore, varied with all the surprising accompaniments of rock and wood; the village of
            <w rend="italics">Grange</w> at the foot of the <w rend="italics">crag</w>, and the
          white houses of <placeName><w rend="italics">Keswick</w></placeName>, with <placeName><w rend="italics">Crosthwaite</w></placeName>
          church at the lower end of the lake; behind these much cultivation, with a beautiful
          mixture of villages, houses, cots, and farms, standing round the skirts of <placeName><w
            rend="italics">Skiddaw</w></placeName>, which rises in the grandest manner, from a verdant base, and
          closes this prospect in the noblest stile of nature's true sublime. From the summit of
          this rock the views are so singularly great and pleasing, that they ought never to be
          omitted. The ascent is by one of the narrow paths cut in the side of the mountain, for
          carrying down the slate, that is quarried on its top.</p>
        <p>The view to the north, or the vale of <placeName><w rend="italics">Keswick</w></placeName>, is already
          described; that to the south lies in <placeName><w rend="italics">Borrowdale</w></placeName>. The river is seen

        <p>the lake, through the rugged pass, to where it divides and embraces a triangular vale,
          completely cut into inclosures of meadow enamelled with the softest verdure, and fields
          waving with fruitful crops. This truly secreted spot is completely surrounded by the most
          horrid, romantic mountains that are in this region of wonders; and whoever omits this <hi

            >Grange</w></placeName>. But no such difficulties as he feared are now to be met with. The road into
            <placeName><w rend="italics">Borrowdale</w></placeName> is improved since his time, at least as far as
          necessary for any one to proceed to see what is curious. It serpentizes through the pass
          above <placeName><w rend="italics">Grange</w></placeName>; and, though upon the edge of a precipice that hangs
          over the river, it is nevertheless safe. This river brings no mixture of mud from the
          mountains of naked rock, and runs, in a channel of slate and granite, as clear as crystal.
          The water of all the lakes in these parts is clear; but the <placeName><w rend="italics">Derwent</w></placeName>
          only is pellucid. In it the smallest</p>

        <p>The rocky scenes in <placeName><w rend="italics">Borrowdale</w></placeName> are most fantastic, and the entrance
          rugged. One rock elbows out, and turns the road directly against another. <placeName><w
            rend="italics">Bowdar-stone</w></placeName>, on the right in the very pafs, is a mountain of itself,
          and the road winds round its base.* Here rock riots over rock, and mountain intersecting
          mountain, forms one grand semicircular sweep. Extensive woods deck their steep sides;
          trees grow from pointed rocks, and rocks appear like trees. Here the <placeName><w rend="italics"
            >Derwent</w></placeName>, rapid as the <placeName><w rend="italics">Rhone</w></placeName>, rolls his crystal dreams through
          all this labyrinth of embattled obstacles. Indeed, the scenes here are so sublimely
          terrible, the assemblage of magnificent objects so stupendously great, and the arrangement
          so extraordinarily curious, that they must excite the most sensible feelings of wonder and
          surprise, and at once impress the mind with reverential awe and admiration.</p>
        <p>The most gigantic mountains that form the outline of this tremendous landscape, and

        <p>divided by bogs and mosses, often difficult to pass, which is, that the mosses here, are
          on the tops of the mountams, and a way over, or round them, is never very difficult to
          find. The <roleName>inhabitants of the dales</roleName>  are served with turf-fewel from these mosses, and the
          manner of procuring it is very singular: A man carries on his back a sledge to the top of
          the mountain, and conducts it down the most awful descents, by placing himself before it
          to prevent its running amain. For this purpose a narrow furrow is cut in the mountain's
          side, which serves for a road to direct the sledge, and to pitch the conductors heel in.—A
          sledge holds one half of what a horse can draw on good road.</p>

        <p>* Every part of nature has something to recommend it to the observation of the
          susceptible and ingenious. A walk, or ride, on the summits of mountains, will afford a
          species of ideas, which though often neither of the social nor luxuriant kind, will
          nevertheless greatly affect and entertain. The large unvariegated features of these hills,
          their elevation, and even their desolate appearance, are all sources of the sublime. And,
          in a publication of this kind, a word or two respecting their nature and characteristic
          properties seems as requisite, as on several other subjects which are here discussed at
          some length.</p>
        <p>The mountains among which these lakes are situated, are formed in general of <w
            rend="italics">two</w> sorts of rock, or stone. The most prevailing kind is a <hi
            rend="italics">blue rag</hi>, and, where it appears, the pasturage which is found among
          it is generally inclined to be mossy, lingy, and wet. These particulars, and a number
          of</p>
        <p>swampy</p>

        <p>Above the cultivated tract, the dale narrows, but the skirts of the mountains are covered
          with the sweetest verdure, and have once waved with aged</p>
        <p>wood.</p>
        <p>swampy patches, or pits of turbary, give the face of these mountains a ratherly savage
          and depressing look; and the indisposition of their soils readily to imbibe the waters
          which fall in rains is the occasion of the number of temporary cataracts which channel
          their sides.</p>
        <p>The other kind of hills consist of <w rend="italics">limestone</w>; and though generally
          of inferior height, their surface is infinitely more pleasing. They are perfectly dry, and
          the bent, or grass, which covers their glades is peculiarly fine. Where this is not found,
          the bare rocks take place, and appear in every fantastic form, which may be supposed to
          have arisen from some violent concussion, to which the earth has heretofore been subject.
          But, the <w rend="italics">whiteness</w> and <w rend="italics">neatness</w> of these rocks
          take off every idea of horror that might be suggested by their bulk, or form From the
          nature of the soil, and the number of communicating clefts of the rocks underground, they
          become soon dry after the heaviest rains; and though they discover no streams of water
          issuing from their sides, a number of the most pellucid ones imaginable are seen bubbling
          out among the inclosures round their bases. On these accounts the face of such hills
          always appears singularly lightsome and chearful. And, on a fine summer day, there is
          little doubt but that the <roleName>curious stranger</roleName> would find a walk or ride on their summits
          (though consisting of nothing but stone and turf) attended with uncommon pleasure. If he
          be of a poetical turn, he will see some of the serenest haunts for the <roleName>shepherd</roleName>, that ever
          fancy formed: If of a philosophic turn, he may be equally delighted with contemplating
          several evident signs of the <hi rend="italics">Mofaie deluge</hi>, and of the <w
            rend="italics">once-soft-state</w> of the calcarious matter which is now hardened into
          rock.—But our limits will not permit us to pursue the subject.</p>

        <p>Just where the road begins to ascend the <w rend="italics">Stake</w> are said to be the
          remains of a bloomery, close by the water-fall on the left; but no tradition relates at
          what time it was last worked. This I could never verify from any visible remains. The
          mineral was found in the mountains, and the wood used in smelting had covered their steep
          sides.</p>

          neatly rounded, covered, in a great measure with small fragments of limestone (called <w
            rend="italics">shil'ow</w>) which gives them, at all times, an uncommon and beautiful
          appearance. But at the latter end of the year, when the foliage of the copses on their
          sides, and the grass which is interspersed along their glades near their tops, have gained
          an olive hue, no objects of the kind can appear more elegantly coloured. <placeName><w rend="italics"

          little be expected to result from a mixture of grass, wood, and stone.</p>

        <p>The masses of iron found on <placeName><w rend="italics">Castle-crag</w></placeName>, were probably smelted
          here. Cataracts and water-falls abound on all sides. A succession of water-falls will meet
          you in the ascent up the <w rend="italics">Stake</w>, and others will accompany you down
          the most dreadful descent into <w rend="italics">Langdale</w>. The scenes on the <w

          miniature of very bad Alpine road across a mountain, just not perpendicular, and about
          five miles over. The road makes many traverses so close, that at every flexure it seems
          almost to return into itself, and such as are advancing in different traverses, appear to
          go different ways. In descending the <w rend="italics">Stake</w>, on the <placeName><w rend="italics"

            Stickle</hi></placeName>, and <placeName><w rend="italics">Steel-pike</w></placeName>, is an inaccessible pyramidal rock,
          and commands the whole. Here nature seems to have discharged all her useless load of
          matter and rock, when form was first impressed on chaos. <placeName><w rend="italics">Pavey-ark</w></placeName>
          is a hanging rock 600 feet in height, and under it is <placeName><w rend="italics">Stickle-tarn</w></placeName>,

            rend="italics">Langdale-pike</w></placeName>, advancing to the clouds his cone-like head, over looks
          them all. What charms the eye in wandering over the vale, is, that not one streight line
          offends. The roads all serpentize round the mountains, and the hedges wave with the
          inclosures. Every thing is thrown into some path of beauty, or agreeable line of nature.
          But to describe every picturesque view, that this region of landscape presents, would be
          an endless labour. And, did language furnish expression to convey ideas of the
          inexhaustible variety that is found in the many grand constituent objects of these
          magnificent scenes, the imagination would be fatigued with the detail, and description
          weakened by redundancy. It is more pleasing to speculative curiosity to discover of itself
          the differences among such scenes as approach the nearest in likeness, and the agreement
          between such as appear most discordant, than to be informed of them. This sport of fancy,

          forming twelve or more of the finest bends and serpentine curves that ever fancy

          fissures, the paths of so many rills and roaring cataracts, that echo through the vales,
          and swell the general torrent. To the east, <placeName><w rend="italics">Cross-fell</w></placeName> is discerned,
          like a cloud of blue mist, hanging over the horizon. In the middle space <placeName><w rend="italics"

          mountain, and concealed by the woods that hang on its steep banks. In the course of the
          descent, remark <placeName><w rend="italics">Threlkeld-pike</w></placeName>, browned with storms, and rent by a
          dreadful wedge-like rock, that tends to the centre. There are many pastoral cots, and

            rend="italics">Skiddaw</w></placeName> and <placeName><w rend="italics">Saddle-back</w></placeName>, sweetly placed and
          picturesque. The northern side is less hospitable, being more precipitous, and much
          concealed in shade. From the bridge the road leads to <w rend="italics">Threlkeld</w>, and

          wooded banks. In a field on the left, near the second mile-post, stands conspicuous, the
          above-mentioned wide circus of rude stones; the awful monument of the barbarous
          superstition which enslaved the minds of ancient times. <persName>Mr. <w rend="italics">Pennant</w></persName>

          sun-set, and saw in my glass a pidture, that if I could transmit to you and fix it in all
          the softness of its living colours, would fairly sell for a thousand pounds. This is the
          sweetest scene I can yet discover in point of pastoral beauty; the rest are in a sublimer

          presides. Leaving these the eye meets a well-wooded hill on the margin of the lake,
          shining in all the beauties of foliage, set off with every advantage of form. Next, a
          noble expanse of water, broken just in the centre by a large island dressed in wood;
          another cultivated and fringed with trees, and a third with hut upon it, stript of its
          ornamental trees, by the unfeeling hand of avarice.* On the eastern side a bold shore,
          steep and wooded to the water's edge, is perceived, and above these, rise daring rocks in
          every horrid shape. Also a strange mixture of wood and rock succeed one another to the
          southern extremity of the lake, where the grand pyramidal <placeName><w rend="italics"

          margin of the lake, and the mountains all around rise immediately from its edge, but those

          picturesque.—These are the parts of the scene <persName>Mr. <w rend="italics">Gray</w></persName> says are the

            <w rend="italics">Brown</w></persName> prefers sailing, and advises landing on every promontory,
          and anchoring in every bay.* The transparent beauty of the lake is only seen in the boat,
          and it is very surprising. The bottom resembles a mosaic pavement of party-coloured stone.
          The fragments of spar at the depth of seven yards, either shine like diamonds, or glitter
          in diversity of colour; and such is the purity of the water, that no mud or ooze defiles
          its bottom. <persName>Mr. <w rend="italics">Pennant</w></persName> navigated the lake, and as his description
          is more compressed than any other, and gives a distinct idea of its appearances, I shall
          here subjoin it.</p>
        <p>"The views on every side are very different: Here all the possible variety of Alpine

        <p>"The two extremities of the lake afford most discordant prospects: The southern is a
          composition of all that is horrible; an immense chasm opens, whose entrance is divided by
          a rude conic hill, once topt with a castle, the habitation of the tyrant of the rocks;
          beyond, a series of broken mountainous crags, now patched with snow, soar one above the
          other, overshadowing the dark winding deep of <placeName><w rend="italics">Borrowdale</w></placeName>. In the
          recesses are lodged variety of minerals, &amp;c.</p>

          often without any apparent cause, as was the case this day; the weather was calm, yet the

        <p><persName>Dr. <w rend="italics">Brown</w></persName> recommends as a conclusion of the tour of this lake, that
          it be viewed by moon-light. He says, "a walk by still moon-light (at which time the

          opens a scene of such delicate beauty, repose and solemnity, as exceeds all
          description."</p>
        <p>An expedition of this kind depends much upon the choice of time in making the tour. It is
          better a little before, than after the full moon. If the evening be still, the voices of
          the water-falls are re-echoed from every rock and cavern, in a manner truly singular and
          pleasing. The setting sun tips the mountains top with the softest resulgence; and the
          rising moon with her silver rays just continues in vision the glories of its base. The
          surface of the lake, that in the day reflects the azure sky, the deep green woods, or
          hoar-coloured rocks, is now a fable mirror, studded with the reflected gems of the starry

          have been occupied with building, as the vestiges of ruins are visible; and, like other
          such places in this region, they were probably secured by the first inhabitants, as places
          of difficult access, and of easy defence. From the bottom of the bay, some waving
          inclosures rise to the side of a green hill, and some scattered houses are seen at the
          upper end of a fine slope of inclosures. The banks of the lake are fringed with trees, and
          under them the crystal water is caught in a pleasing manner. At the north west corner the
            <placeName><w rend="italics">Derwent</w></placeName> issues from the lake, and is spanned by a handsome
          stone-bridge of three arches. The whole western boundary is the noble range of wooded
          hills, called <placeName><w rend="italics">Wythop-brows</w></placeName>. On the eastern shore the lake retires
          behind a peninsula, that rushes far into the water, and on its extreme point a solitary
          oak, waving to every wind, is most picturesque. This is <placeName><w rend="italics">Scareness</w></placeName>.
          The coast upward is a fine cultivated tract to the skirts of <placeName><w rend="italics"
          >Skiddaw</w></placeName>. Far to the south, <placeName><w rend="italics">Wallow-crag</w></placeName> with all the range of

        <p>craggy mountains in <placeName><w rend="italics">Borrowdale</w></placeName>, are seen in fine perspective; and
          on their outline the spiral point of <placeName><w rend="italics">Langdale-pike</w></placeName> appears blue as
          glass. The deep green woods of <placeName><w rend="italics">Foe-park</w></placeName>, and the golden front of
          <placeName><w rend="italics">Swinside</w></placeName>, form a pleasing termination.</p>
        <p>STATION II. Return to the road by <placeName><w rend="italics">Scareness</w></placeName>, and descend from the
          house to the oak tree, on the extremity of the promontory. The lake is here narrowest, but
          immediately spreading itself on both hands, forms two semicircular bays. That on the right
          is a mile across; the bay on the left is smaller; the shore on both sides is finely
          variegated with low wood and scattered bushes, as is more especially the peninsula itfelf.
          The upper bay is perfectly circular and finely wooded. In front, <placeName><w rend="italics"
            >Wythop-brows</w></placeName> rise swift from the water's edge. The extremity of some inclosures,
          are picturesquely seen just over the wood, with part of a cottage. The village of <placeName><w
            rend="italics">Wythop</w></placeName> lies behind it in an aerial site. A grass inclosure, scooped
          in the bosom of the hanging wood, and under it a cot, on the very brink of the lake,
          stands sweetly. The views downward are fine; the banks high and woody to the bridge, of
          which two arches are in sight. Behind it a white house is charmingly placed. More to the
          right, at the head of a gentle slope, in the very centre of view, stands <placeName><w rend="italics"
            >Armathwaite</w></placeName>, winged with groves; and behind, at a small distance, are deep hanging
          woods, and over them, spreading far to the right and left, a great</p>
        <p>reach</p>
        <pb n="138" facs="660.jp2"/>
        <p>THE LAKES. <seg type="pagenumber">119</seg></p>
        <p>reach of cultivated grounds. This termination is rich, and pleasing to the eye. The view
          to the south is as on the upper lake, much softened by distance. In the afternoon, if the
          sun shine, the appearance of the silver-grey rocks, glistening through the green woods
          that hang on their fissures, is most elegant. Behind an appendix of <placeName><w rend="italics"
            >Skiddaw</w></placeName> rises in rude form; and over it this chief of mountains frowns in Alpine
          majesty.—This view is also well seen from the house of <w rend="italics"
          >Scareness</w>.</p>
        <p>STATION III. The next remarkable promontory is <placeName><w rend="italics">Bradness</w></placeName>, a round
          green hill, that spreading itself into the lake, forms a bay, with <placeName><w rend="italics"
            >Bowness</w></placeName> to the south. The best general view of the lake is from the crown of this
          hill, behind the farm house. Here you look over three bays finely formed. Nothing can be
          imagined more elegant than the sinuosity of this side, contrasted with the steep shore and
          lofty woods of the opposite. The view upwards is not less charming, being indented and
          wooded to the water's edge.</p>
        <p>If these views are taken beginning with <placeName><w rend="italics">Bradness</w></placeName>, then, from <placeName><w
            rend="italics">Scareness</w></placeName> take the road to <placeName><w rend="italics">Bassenthwaite-halls</w></placeName>
          (a few houses so called) and from the road on the north side of the village, called <placeName><w
            rend="italics">Rakes</w></placeName>, you have a very fine view of a rich cultivated tract,
          stretching along the banks of the lake, and spreading itself upwards to the skirts of <placeName><w
            rend="italics">Skiddaw</w></placeName>. The elevation is such, that every object</p>

        <p>is seen completely, and every beauty distinctly marked. The lake appears in its full
          magnitude, shaded by a bold wooded shore on the west, and graced by a sweet spreading vale
          on the east, that terminates in a bold stile under the surrounding mountains. The sloping
          ground to the bridge is charming, and the far extended vales of <placeName><w rend="italics"
            >Embleton</w></placeName> and <placeName><w rend="italics">Isel</w></placeName> lie in fine perspective. The river <placeName><w
            rend="italics">Derwent</w></placeName> has his winding course through the latter.</p>
        <p>ANTIQUITIES. <placeName><w rend="italics">Caer-mot</w></placeName> is about two miles further to the north, on
          the great road to old <placeName><w rend="italics">Carlisle</w></placeName> and <placeName><w rend="italics">Wigton</w></placeName>. It
          is a green high crowned hill, and on its skirt, just by the road side, are the manifest
          vestiges of a square encampment, inclosed with a double foss, extending from east to west
          120 paces, and from south to north, 100 paces. It is subdivided into several cantonments,
          and the road from <placeName><w rend="italics">Keswick</w></placeName> to old <placeName><w rend="italics">Carlisle</w></placeName> has
          crossed it at right angles. Part of the <w rend="italics">agger</w> is visible where it
          issues from the north side of the camp, till where it falls in with the line of the
          present road. It is distant about ten miles from <placeName><w rend="italics">Keswick</w></placeName>, as much
          from old <placeName><w rend="italics">Carlisle</w></placeName>, and is about two miles west of <placeName><w rend="italics"

        <p>there remain no vestiges of either. By its being in a deep glen, among surrounding hills,
          where there is no pass to guard, or country to protect, a body of men could be of no use.
          On the northern extremity of the said hill of <placeName><w rend="italics">Caer-mot</w></placeName> are the
          remains of a beacon, and near it the vestiges of a square encampment, inclosed with a foss
          and rampart of 60 feet by 70. This camp is in full view of <hi rend="italics">Blatumbulgii
            (<placeName>Bowness</placeName></hi>) and <w rend="italics">Olenacum</w> (<placeName>old <w rend="italics">Carlisle</w></placeName>,)
          and, commanding the whole extent of the <placeName><w rend="italics">Solway-frith</w></placeName>, would receive
          the first notice from any frontier station, where the <w rend="italics">Caledonians</w>
          might make an attempt to cross the frith, or had actually broke in upon the province; and
          notice of this might be communicated by the beacon on <placeName><w rend="italics">Caer-mot</w></placeName> to
          the garrison at <placeName><w rend="italics">Keswick</w></placeName>, by the watch on <placeName><w rend="italics"
            >Castle-crag</w></placeName> in <placeName><w rend="italics">Borrowdale</w></placeName>. The garrison at <placeName><w rend="italics"
            >Keswick</w></placeName> would have the care of the beacon on the top of <placeName><w rend="italics"
            >Skiddaw</w></placeName>; the mountain being of the easiest access on that side. By this means the
          alarm would soon become general, and the invaders be either terrified into flight, or else
          the whole country quickly in arms to oppose them.</p>
        <p>Whether these camps are the <placeName><w rend="italics">Arbeia</w></placeName> I pretend not to say, but that
          they were of use to the <trait type="ethnicity">

          and therefore could only be occupied in the summer months. They seem to have the same
          relation to old <placeName><w rend="italics">Carlisle</w></placeName> and <placeName><w rend="italics">Keswick</w></placeName>, as the
          camp at <placeName><w rend="italics">Whitbarrow</w></placeName> has to old <placeName><w rend="italics">Penrith</w></placeName> and <placeName><w

        <p>From <placeName><w rend="italics">Caer-mot</w></placeName> descend to <placeName><w rend="italics">Ouse-bridge</w></placeName>, and
          return to <placeName><w rend="italics">Keswick</w></placeName> up the western side of the lake. Every lover of
          landscape should take this ride in the afternoon; and if the sun shines, it is exceedingly
          pleasant. The road branches off from the great road to <placeName><w rend="italics">Cockermouth</w></placeName> a
          little below the bridge, and leads through the wood, and round <placeName><w rend="italics"
            >Castle-how</w></placeName>. In some places it rises above the lake a considerable height, and the
          water is agreeably seen at intervals through a screen of low wood, that decks its banks.
          Then the road descends to the level of the water, and presents you with a variety of
          surprising views in different stiles, that shew themselves in an agreeable succession, as
          the eye wanders in amazement along the lake.</p>
        <p>STATION IV. At <placeName><w rend="italics">Beck-wythop</w></placeName> the lake spreads out to a great expanse
          of water, and its outlet is concealed by <placeName><w rend="italics">Castle-how</w></placeName>. The immediate
          shore is lined with rocks, that range along banks completely dressed in low wood, and over
          them <placeName><w rend="italics">Wythop-brows</w></placeName> rise almost: perpendicular. The opposite shore is
          much variegated, and deeply embayed by the bold promontories of <placeName><w rend="italics"

          a little removed from the margin of the lake, and under a range of wood, see the solitary
          church of <placeName><w rend="italics">Bassenthwaite</w></placeName>. Its back-ground is gloomy <placeName><w rend="italics"
            >Ullock</w></placeName>; a descendant hill of parent <placeName><w rend="italics">Skiddaw</w></placeName>, robed in purple
          heath, trimmed with soft verdure. The whole cultivated tract between the mountains and the
          lake is seen here in all its beauty, and <placeName><w rend="italics">Skiddaw</w></placeName> appears no where of
          such majestic height as from this point, being seemingly magnified by the accompaniment of
          the lesser hills that surround its base.</p>
        <p>Over the northern extremity of this expanse of water, the ground rises in an easy slope,
          and in the point of beauty <placeName><w rend="italics">Armathwaite</w></placeName> is seated, queen of the lake,
          on which she smiles in graceful beauty. On each hand are hanging woods. The space between
          displays much cultivation, and is divided by inclosures, waving up the farms seen under
          the skirts of <placeName><w rend="italics">Caer-mot</w></placeName>, the crown-topt hill, that closes this scene
          in the sweetest and most elegant manner possible. If the sun shine you may be entertained
          here for hours with a pleasing variety of landscapes. All the views up the lake are in a
          stile great and sublime. They are seen in the bosom of the lake softened by reflection,
          but to the glass is reserved the finished picture, in the truest colouring, and most just
          perspective. As you come out of the wood, at the gate leading to the open space, there is
          a magnificent bird's-eye view</p>

        <p>* On taking leave of <placeName><w rend="italics">Bassenthwaite-water</w></placeName> we may observe, that it
          was the <w rend="italics">first</w> lake that was honoured with one of those amusements
          called <w rend="italics">Regattas</w>; this was on the <label><date>24th of <w rend="italics"

          opportunity of seeing it, that every representation, in the absence of the beauties that
          surround the scene, must fall infinitely short of the romantic grandeur it labours to hold
          up to the imagination.</p>
        <p>"At <label><date>eight o'clock in the morning</date></label>, a vast concourse of ladies and gentlemen appeared on
          the side of the <placeName><w rend="italics">Derwent</w> lake</placeName>, where a number of marquees, extending
          about four hundred yards, were erected for their accomodation. At twelve, such of the

          to the island which bears his name; and, on their landing, were saluted by a discharge of

            >Regatta</w>; for as soon as the echo of this discharge had ceased, a signal gun was
          fired, and five boats, which lay upon their oars, (on that part of the water which runs
          nearest the town of <placeName><w rend="italics">Keswick</w></placeName>) instantly pushed off the shore, and

        <p>the blue and yellow mountains sides, produces effects of light and shade, the most
          charming that ever a son of <w rend="italics">Apelles</w> imagined. In approaching the
          head of <placeName><w rend="italics">Newland-hawse</w></placeName>, on the left, a mountain of purple-coloured
          rock presents a thousand gaping chasms, excavated by torrents that fall into a bason,
          formed in the bosom of the mountain, and from thence, precipitating themselves over a wall
          of rock, become a brook below. In front is a vast rocky mountain, the barrier of the dell,
          that opposes itself to all further access. Among the variety of water-falls that
          distinguish this awful boundary of rock, one catches the eye at a distance, that exceeds
          the boasted <placeName><w rend="italics">Lowdore</w></placeName>, in height of rock, and unity of fall, whilst
          the beholder is free from all anxiety of mind in the approach. Not one pebble or grain of

          ride.</p>
        <p>The road, or rather tract, becomes now less agreeable than it was, for a few roods, not
          from any difficulty there is in turning the finest mountain turf into good road at a small
          expence, but from the inattention of the dalesmen, who habituate themselves to tread in
          the tract made by their flocks, and wish for nothing better. It will not be labour lost to
          walk a few roods here, and see a new creation of mountains, as unlike those left behind,
          as the <w rend="italics">Andes</w> are to the <w rend="italics">Alps</w>. The contrast is
          really striking, and appears at once on the summit of the hill. On the right, at the head
          of a deep green dell, a naked furrowed mountain of an orange hue, has a strange appearance
          amongst his verdant neighbours, and sinks, by his height, even <placeName><w rend="italics"
            >Skiddaw</w></placeName> itself.</p>
        <p>Descend the tract on the left, and you soon have in sight, the highest possible contrast
          in nature. Four spiral towering mountains, dark, dun, and gloomy at noon-day, rise
          immediately from the western extremity of the deep narrow dell, and hang over <placeName><w

          volcano in some distant period of time, when the cones were produced by explosion. At
          present it is the reservoir of water that feeds the roaring cataract you see in the
          descent to <placeName><w rend="italics">Buttermere</w></placeName>. Here all is barrenness, solitude and silence,
          only interrupted by the murmurs of a rill, that runs unseen in the narrow bottom of a deep
          dell.* The smooth verdant sides of the vast hills on the right, have many furrows engraven
          in their sides by the winter rains; and the fable mountains in front, present all the

        <p>traces of industry obtruding themselves at the foot of the glen, disturb the solemn
          solitude with which the eye and mind have been entertained, and point out your return to
          society; for you now approach the village of <placeName><w rend="italics">Buttermere</w></placeName>, which is
          situated betwixt the lakes, and consists of sixteen houses. The chapel here is very small,
          the stipend not large, for, though twice augmented with the queen's bounty, it exceeds not
          twenty pounds per ann. This is one of the cures <persName>Mr. <w rend="italics">Pennant</w></persName>
          mentions; but the perquisites of the clog-shoes, harden-fark, whittle-gate, and
          goose-gate, have no better support than in some ancient, and, probably, <w rend="italics"
            >idle</w> tale.</p>
        <p>The life of the inhabitants is purely pastoral. A few hands are employed in the slate
          quarries; the <roleName>women</roleName> spin woollen yarn and drink tea. Above the village you have a view of
          the upper lake, two miles in length, and short of one in breadth. It is terminated on the
          western side by the ferruginous mountain already mentioned. A stripe of cultivated ground
          adorns the eastern shore. A group of houses, called <placeName><w rend="italics">Gatesgarth</w></placeName>, is
          seated on the southern extremity, under the most extraordinary amphitheatre of mountainous
          rocks that ever eye beheld. Here we see <placeName><w rend="italics">Honister-crag</w></placeName> rise to an
          immense height, flanked by two conic mountains, <placeName><w rend="italics">Fleetwith</w></placeName> on the
          eastern, and <placeName><w rend="italics">Scarf</w></placeName> on the western side. A hundred mountain torrents
          form never failing cataracts that thunder and foam down the centre of the rock, and form

        <p>below. Here the rocky scenes and mountain landscapes are diversified and contrasted with
          all that aggrandizes the object in the most sublime stile, and constitute a picture the
          most enchanting of any in these parts.</p>
        <p><persName>Mr. <w rend="italics">Gray</w></persName>'s account of <placeName><w rend="italics">Barrowside</w></placeName>, and his
          relation of <placeName><w rend="italics">Borrowdale</w></placeName>, are hyperboles; the sport of fancy he was
          pleased to indulge himself in. A person that has crossed the <w rend="italics">Alps</w> or
            <w rend="italics">Apennines</w>, will meet here only miniatures of the huge rocks and
          precipices, the vast hills, and snow-topt mountains he saw there. And though he may
          observe much similarity in the stile, there is none in the danger. <hi rend="italics"
            ><placeName>Skiddaw</placeName>, <placeName>Helvellyn</placeName></hi>, and <placeName><w rend="italics">Catchidecam</w></placeName>, are but dwarfs when
          compared with <placeName>mount <w rend="italics">Maudite</w></placeName> above <placeName>the lake of <w rend="italics"
            >Geneva</w></placeName>, and the guardian <placeName>mountains of the <w rend="italics">Rhone</w></placeName>. If the roads
          in some places be narrow and difficult, they are at least safe. No <roleName>villainous banditti</roleName>
          haunt the mountains; innocent people live in the dells. Every <roleName>cottager</roleName> is narrative of ail
          he knows; and mountain virtue, and pastoral hospitality are found at every farm. This
          constitutes a pleasing difference betwixt travelling here and on the continent, where
          every <roleName>inn-holder</roleName> is an extortioner, and every <roleName>voiturin</roleName> an imposing rogue.</p>
        <p>The space betwixt the lakes is not a mile, and consists of pasture and meadow ground. The

        <p>Soon opens after you leave the village, and pass through an oaken grove. A fine expanse
          of water sweeps away to the right under a rocky promontory, <placeName><w rend="italics"
            >Randon-knot</w></placeName>, or <w rend="italics">Buttermere-hawse</w>. The road then serpentizes
          round the rock, and under a rugged pyramidal craggy mountain. From the crest of this rock
          the whole extent of the lake is discovered. On the western side the mountains rise
          immediately from the water's edge, bold and abrupt. Just in front, between <placeName><w
            rend="italics">Blea-crag</w></placeName> and <placeName><w rend="italics">Mellbreak</w></placeName>, (two spiral hills) the
          hoarse resounding noise of a water-fall is heard across the lake, concealed within the
          bosom of the cliff, through which it has forced its way, and when viewed from the foot of
          the fall, is a most astonishing phenomenon.</p>
        <p>This lake is beautified with three small isles. One of rock, lies juft before you. The
          whole eastern shore is diversified with bays, the banks with scattered trees, and a few
          inclosures, terminated by a hanging wood. At the foot of the lake a high crowned hill
          pushes forward, fringed with trees, and sweetly laid out with inclosures. And above it, on
          a cultivated slope, is <placeName>the chapel of <w rend="italics">Lowes-water</w></placeName>, surrounded with
          scattered farms.</p>
        <p>Behind</p>
        <p>* This lake abounds with the finest char, and red trout; and contains also some pike and
          perch.</p>
        <pb n="152" facs="674.jp2"/>
        <p>THE LAKES. <seg type="pagenumber">135</seg></p>
        <p>Behind all, <placeName><w rend="italics">Low-fell</w></placeName> raises his verdant front; a sweet contrast to
          his murky neighbours, and a pleasing termination, either as seen from the top of this
          rock, or from the bosom of the lake.</p>
        <p>The chain of pyramidal mountains on each side of this narrow vale, are extremely
          picturesque. They rise from distinct bases, and swell into the most grotesque forms of
          serrated, or broken rocks.</p>
        <p>These lakes are of a much greater depth than <placeName><w rend="italics">Derwent-water</w></placeName>, and
          this may be the only reason why they have char, and some others have not. The char in the
          summer months retire to the deeps, probably to avoid the heat. The water here is clear,
          but not so transparent as <placeName>the lake of <w rend="italics">Derwent</w></placeName>. The outlet is at the
          north east corner, by <placeName>the river <w rend="italics">Cocker</w></placeName>, over which is a handsome
          stone-bridge of four arches. This lake is four miles in length, and in some places almost
          half a mile over.</p>

        <p>Proceed from the bridge by <placeName><w rend="italics">High-cross</w></placeName> to <placeName><w rend="italics"
            >Lowes-water</w></placeName>. Having passed through a gate that leads to the common, the lake
          spreads out before you, a mile in length, and of an equal breadth of about a quarter of a
          mile. The extremities are rivals in beauty of hanging woods, little groves, and waving
          inclosures, with farms</p>

        <p>seated in the sweetest points of view. The south end is overlooked by lofty <placeName><w
            rend="italics">Mellbreak</w></placeName>, at whose foot a white house, within some grass inclosures,
          under a few trees, stands in the point of beauty. The eastern shore is open, and indented
          with small bays, but the opposite side is more pleasing. <placeName><w rend="italics"
            >Carling-knot</w></placeName> presents a broad pyramidal front of swift afcent, covered with soft
          vegetation, and spotted with many aged solitary thorns. On each side the outlines wave
          upward in the finest manner, terminating in a cone of grey rock, patched with verdure.</p>
        <p>This lake, in opposition to all the other lakes, has its course from north to south, and
          under <placeName><w rend="italics">Mellbreak</w></placeName> falls into <placeName><w rend="italics">Cromack-water</w></placeName>. It
          is of no great depth, and without char; but it abounds with pike, and perch, and has some
          trout.</p>
        <p>An evening view of both lakes, is from the side of <placeName><w rend="italics">Mellbreak</w></placeName>, at
          the gate, under a coppice of oak, in the road to <placeName><w rend="italics">Ennerdale</w></placeName>. Nothing
          exceeds, in composition, the parts of this landscape. They are all great, and lie in fine
          order of perspective. If the view be taken from the round knoll at the lower end of the
          lake, the appearance of the mountains that bound it is astonishing. You have <placeName><w
            rend="italics">Mellbreak</w></placeName> on the right, and <placeName><w rend="italics">Grasmire</w></placeName> on the
          left, and betwixt them, a stupendous amphitheatre of mountains, whose tops are all broken
          and dissimilar, and of different hues, and their</p>
        <p>bases</p>
        <pb n="154" facs="676.jp2"/>
        <p>THE LAKES. <seg type="pagenumber">137</seg></p>
        <p>bases skirted with wood, or cloathed with verdure. In the centre point of this
          amphitheatre, is a huge pyramidal broken rock, that seems with its figure to change place
          as you move across the foreground, and gives much variety to the scenes, and alters the
          picture at every pace. In short, the picturesque views in this district are many, some
          mixt, others purely sublime but all surprise and please. The genius of the greatest adepts
          in landscape might here improve in taste and judgment; and the most enthustastic ardor for
          pastoral poetry and painting, will here find an inexhaustible source of scenes and
          images.</p>

        <p>From the bridge, at the foot of the lake, ascend the road to <placeName><w rend="italics"

          <placeName>Skiddaw</placeName> of the vale) frowns in all the majesty of furrowed rock, cut almost
          perpendicularly to the center by the water-falls of ages. The swell of a cataract is here
          heard, but entirely concealed within the gloomy recess of a rocky dell, formed by the
          rival mountains, <placeName><w rend="italics">Grasmire</w></placeName> and <placeName><w rend="italics">White-side</w></placeName>. At
          their feet lie the mighty ruins, brought down from the mountains by the memorable

          here merit a perusal.</p>
        <p>In the evening of the <label><date>22nd of August, 1749</date></label>, that day having been much hotter than was ever
          known in these parts, a strange and frightful noise was heard in the air, which continued
          for some time, to the great surprise of the inhabitants, sounding over them like a strong
          wind, though they could not perceive it. This was succeeded by the most terrible claps of
          thunder, and incessant slashes of lightening breaking over their heads. At the same time
          the clouds poured down whole torrents of water on the mountains to the east, which in a
          very little time swelled the channels of their rivulets and brooks, so as to overflow
          every bank, and overwhelm almost every obstacle in their way. In a moment they deluged the
          whole valley below, and covered with stones, earth, and sand,</p>

        <p>After this, the mountains become humble hills, and terminate the sweet vale, that

        <p>many acres of fine cultivated ground. Several thousands of huge fragments of broken rocks
          were driven by the impetuosity of these dreadful cataracts into the fields below, and such
          was their bulk that some of them were more than ten horses could move, and one fairly
          measured nineteen yards in circumference. A corn-mill, dwelling-house, and stable, all
          under one roof, lay in the tract of one of these currents, and the mill from the one end,
          and the stable from the other, were both swept away, leaving the little habitation
          standing in the middle, rent open at both ends, with the miller, who was very old and
          infirm, in bed, and who was ignorant of the matter till he rose next morning to behold
          nothing but ruin and desolation. His mill was no more; and instead of seeing green ground
          in the vale below, all was covered with large stones, and rubbish, four yards deep, and
          among which one of the mill-stones was irrecoverably lost. The old channel of the stream
          too was entirely choaked up, and a new one cut open on the other side of the building,
          through the middle of a large rock, four yards wide, and nine deep.—Something similar to
          this happened at several other places in the neighbourhood, for the space of two miles,
          along <placeName><w rend="italics">Legberthwaite</w></placeName>, and <placeName><w rend="italics">Fornside</w></placeName>, but

        <p>In the year <label><date>1772</date></label>, near <placeName><w rend="italics">Little-Blencow</w></placeName>, in removing a heap of
          stones, two urns were taken up, about two feet and a half high, made of very coarse earth,
          and crusted on both sides with a brown clay, the tops remarkably wide, and covered with a
          red flat stone. Besides ashes and bones, each urn had a small cup within it, of a fine
          clay, in the shape of a tea-cup. One was pierced in the centre of the bottom part. The

          with an inscription; the letters short and square, but not one word remains legible. On

        <p>The castrum is 168 paces from south to north, by 110 within the foss; which was also

            >Dunmail-raise</w></placeName>, and a garrison at <placeName><w rend="italics">Keswick</w></placeName> commanded both these

          what has been advanced. But this may only prove, that no care was taken to preserve the
          memory of such remains, and that the town occupies the whole area of the station, and that
          the station had been placed within the site of the town, probably in the lower part,
          facing the pass of the <placeName><w rend="italics">Greeta</w></placeName>. In the wheel of the <placeName><w rend="italics"
            >Greeta</w></placeName>, in a meadow peninsulated by the river, just below the town, and called <placeName><w
            rend="italics">Goats-field</w></placeName>, there are vestiges of a foss, but too imperfect to draw
          a conclusion from, in favour of the station. The ground round the town is very fertile,
          and has been long enough cultivated to destroy any remains of it, and what have been
          accidentally discovered may be gone into oblivion, and no change happening in the town
          itself to occasion new discoveries, farther proofs may still be wanting. If <placeName><w

          made a market." The face of the country only drew; his attention. That <placeName><w rend="italics"

          and the other reasons already assigned, it appeared evident that a station must be some
          where near. The <placeName><w rend="italics">Castle-hill</w></placeName>, above <placeName><w rend="italics">Keswick</w></placeName>, is
          a faithful record of the existence of a station in this country. Here was the feat of the
          ancient lords of the manor of <placeName><w rend="italics">Derwent-water</w></placeName>, probably raised on the
            ruins of the <trait type="ethnicity">

            </trait> fortress: But after the heiress of that family was married to <persName><w

          into <placeName><w rend="italics">Northumberland</w></placeName>, and the castle went to ruins; 
          and with the stones thereof the <persName><w rend="italics">Ratcliffs</w></persName> built a house of pleasure in one of the islands in <placeName>Derwent-water</placeName>,* The name <placeName><w rend="italics">Castle-hill</w></placeName>, 
          being more ancient than the last erection, is still retained. At <placeName><w rend="italics"
            >Ambleside</w></placeName>, when I enquired for the <trait type="ethnicity">
              <label>Roman</label>
            </trait> station, a few years ago, no person could
          inform me of it, till one considering my description, answered, it is the castle. The

            <placeName><w rend="italics">Castle-steads</w></placeName>. So here the <placeName><w rend="italics">Castle-hill</w></placeName> was
          probably the place of the summer station, but being a fruitful tract, and much plowed, I
          have not been able to trace any appearance of a foss, or vallum, and therefore the whole

        <p><persName>Mr. <w rend="italics">Gray</w></persName>'s choice of visiting this lake was from <placeName><w rend="italics"
            >Penrith</w></placeName>, up <placeName>the vale of <w rend="italics">Emont</w></placeName>. "A grey autumnal day, (he
          writes) went to see <placeName><w rend="italics">Ulls-water</w></placeName>, five miles distant; soon left <placeName><w
            rend="italics">Keswick</w></placeName>p road, and turned to the left through shady lanes along the
          vale of <placeName><w rend="italics">Emont</w></placeName>, which runs rapidly on near the way, rippling over the
          stones; to the right <placeName><w rend="italics">Dalemain</w></placeName> large fabrick of pale red stone, with
          nine windows in front, and seven on the side. Further on, <placeName><hi rend="italics">Hutton St.
            John</hi></placeName>, a castle-like old mansion of <persName>Mr. <w rend="italics">Huddleston's</w></persName>. Approach
          <placeName><w rend="italics">Dunmallet</w></placeName>, a fine pointed hill, covered with wood. Began to mount
          the hill, and with some toil gained the summit. From hence saw the lake opening directly
          at my feet, majestic in its calmness, clear and smooth as a blue mirror, with winding
          shores, and low points of land, covered with green inclosure, white farm houses looking
          out among the trees, and cattle feeding. The water is almost every where bordered with
          cultivated lands, gently sloping upwards, from a mile to a quarter of a mile, in breadth,
          till they reach the feet of the mountains, which rise very rude and awful with their
          broken tops on either hand. Directly in front, at better than three miles distance, <placeName><w
            rend="italics">Place-fell</w></placeName>, one of the bravest amongst them, pushes its bold breast
          into the midst of the lake, and forces it to alter its course, forming first a large bay
          to the left, and then bending to the right. Descended <placeName><w rend="italics">Dunmallet</w></placeName> by a
          side avenue, only not perpendicular, and came to <placeName><w rend="italics">Barton-bridge</w></placeName> over

            rend="italics">Emont</w></placeName> issues out of the lake, and continued my way along the western
          shore, close to the water, and generally on a level with it; it is nine miles long, and at
          widest under a mile in breadth. After extending itself three miles and a half in a line to
          the south west, it turns at the foot of <placeName><w rend="italics">Place-fell</w></placeName> almost due west,
          and is here not twice the breadth of the <placeName><w rend="italics">Thames</w></placeName> at <placeName><w rend="italics"
            >London</w></placeName>. It is soon again interrupted by the root of <placeName><w rend="italics"
          >Helvellyn</w></placeName>, a lofty and very rugged mountain, and spreading again turns off to the
          south east, and is lost among the deep recesses of hills. To this second turning I pursued
          my way, about four miles along its borders, beyond a village scattered among trees, and
          called <placeName><w rend="italics">Watermillock</w></placeName>." Here <persName>Mr. <w rend="italics">Gray</w></persName> leaves us,
          and the greatest part of the lake unseen, and its most picturesque parts undescribed. For
          the last bend of the lake is spotted with rocky isses, deeply indented with wooded
          promontories on one side, and rocks on the other, from which result many a truly pleasing
          picture.</p>
        <p>ANTIQUITIES. Before you quit the top of <placeName><w rend="italics">Dumnallet</w></placeName>, observe the

          37, surrounded with a foss, is yet visible, and stones of the rampart still peep through
          the grass. The well that supplied the guard kept here, was but lately filled with
          stones.</p>

        <p>This fort must have been of much consequence in guarding the lake and commanding the
          pass, and in maintaining a connexion between the garrisons of <placeName><w rend="italics"
            >Ambleside</w></placeName> and <placeName><w rend="italics">Brougham</w></placeName>, it being five or six mile distant
          from the latter, and nineteen from the former. There are also strong vestiges of a square
          fort on <placeName><w rend="italics">Soulby-fell</w></placeName>, which communicates with this and the camp at <placeName><w
            rend="italics">Whitbarrow</w></placeName>.</p>
        <p>Opposite to <placeName><w rend="italics">Watermillock</w></placeName> a cataract descends down the front of <placeName><w
            rend="italics">Swarth-fell</w></placeName>, in <placeName><w rend="italics">Martindale</w></placeName> forest. At <placeName><w
            rend="italics">Skelling-nab</w></placeName>, a bold promontory, the lake is contracted to a span,
          but it soon spreads itself again both ways, forming a variety of sweet bays and
          promontories. After a reach of three miles, it winds, with a grand sweep, round the smooth
          breast of <placeName><w rend="italics">Place-fell</w></placeName>, and making a turn directly south, advances
          with equal breadth towards <placeName><w rend="italics">Patterdale</w></placeName>. The western shore is various.
          Drawing near the second bend, the mountains strangely intersect each other. Behind many
          wooded hills, rises <placeName><w rend="italics">Stone-cross-pike</w></placeName>, and over all, steep <placeName><w

            >Gowbarrow-park</w></placeName> opens with a grand amphitheatre of shining rock, the floor of which
          is spread with soft green pasture, once shaded with ancient oaks, to which many decayed

          finest scenes that can be imagined. At the upper end of <placeName><w rend="italics"
            >Gowbarrow-park</w></placeName> the laid bend of the lake, which is by much the finest, opens,
          scattered with small rocky islands. The shores are bold, rocky, wooded, and much embayed.
          Pass <placeName><w rend="italics">New-bridge</w></placeName>, and the road winds up a steep rock, having the lake
          underneath you on the left. From the top, you have a view under the trees, both up and
          down the lake. <placeName><w rend="italics">Martindale-fell</w></placeName>, a naked grey rock, on the opposite
          shore, rises abruptly from the water, to an Alpine height, and with an astonishing effect.
          The rock you stand upon hangs over the lake, which seems blue and unfathomable to the eye.
          An island in the middle space has a beautiful appearance. This is the most romantic,
          striking, and terrible situation upon the lake, especially if the wind blow the surges of
          the water against the rock below you. The shores on both sides upward are very pleasing,
          and the little decorating isles are scattered in the most exquisite taste, and delightful
          order. The ride along the banks, since the repair of the road, is charming.</p>
        <p>The upper end terminates in sweet meadows, surrounded on the right by towering, rocky
          hills, broken and wooded. <placeName><w rend="italics">Martindale-fell</w></placeName> is the opposite boundary,
          skirted here with hanging inclosures, cots, and farms.</p>

        <p>The principal feeders of this lake are <placeName><w rend="italics">Grysdale-beck</w></placeName>, on the

        <p>From the bridge in <hi rend="italics"><placeName>Patterdale</placeName>, <placeName>Goldrill-beck</placeName></hi> serpentizes sweetly
          through the meadows, and falls easily into the lake about the middle of the vale. <placeName><w

            >Westmorland</w></placeName> and <placeName><w rend="italics">Cumberland</w></placeName>.</p>
        <p>There is, from the top of the rock above the inn, a very charming view of the last bend
          of the lake, which constitutes one of the finest landscapes on it, and takes in just
          enough for a delightful picture. The nearest fore-ground is a fall of inclosures. A rocky
          wooded mountain that hangs over <placeName><w rend="italics">Patterdale-house</w></placeName> (called <placeName><w
            rend="italics">Martindale-fell</w></placeName>) is in a proper point of distance on the right. Steep

            >Gowbarrow-park</w></placeName> rises in a fine stile from the water edge for the back ground, and a
          noble reach of water, beautifully spotted with rocky isles, charmingly disposed, with
          perpetual change of rocky shore, fill the middle space of this beautiful picture.</p>

          are said to be taken in it.</p>
        <p>The water of the lake is very clear, but has nothing of the transparency of <w
            rend="italics">Derwent</w>, and is inferior to <placeName><w rend="italics">Buttermere</w></placeName> and <placeName><w
            rend="italics">Cromack-water</w></placeName> also in this respect. The stones in the bottom, and
          along the shores, are coated with mud.</p>
        <p><placeName>Mr. <w rend="italics">Gray</w></placeName> viewed this lake, in the same manner as that at <placeName><w
            rend="italics">Keswick</w></placeName>, proceeding along its banks, and facing the mountains,
          judging that the idea of magnitude and magnificence were thereby increased, and the whole
          set off with every advantage of fore-ground. But this lake viewed from any height except
            <placeName><w rend="italics">Dunmallet</w></placeName>, also loses much of its dignity, as a lake, from the
          number of its flexures, and juttings out of promontories; it nevertheless retains the
          appearance of a magnificent river ingulphed in rocks.</p>
        <p>The bold winding hills, the intersecting mountains, the pyramidal cliffs, the bulging,
          broken, rugged rocks, the hanging woods, and the tumbling, roaring cataract, are parts of
          the sublimer scenes presented in this surprising vale. The cultivated spots wave upward
          from the water in beautiful slopes, intersected by hedges, decorated with trees in the
          most pleasing manner; mansions, cottages, and farms, placed in the sweetest

        <p>are the rural parts, and altogether form the most delightful and charming scenes. The
          accompaniments of this lake are disposed in the most picturesque order, bending round its
          margin, and spreading upwards in craggy rocks and mountains, irregular in outline; yet
          they are certainly much inferior in sublimity, and horrible grandeur to the environs of <placeName><w

          But in this opinion we have <persName>Mr. <w rend="italics">Cumberland</w></persName> against us, who, having
          visited the other lakes in dark unfavourable weather, when nothing could be seen besides
          weeping rocks, flooded roads, and watery plains, darkened by fable clouds, that hovered
          over them and concealed their variegated shores,—entertained an unfavourable idea of them;
          and being more fortunate in a fine day, in that part of the tour, where he visited <placeName><w

        <p>The navigators of this lake find much amusement by discharging guns, or small cannon, at
          certain stations. The effect is indeed truly curious. For the report is reverberated from
          rock to rock, promontory, cavern, and hill, with every variety of sound; now dying away
          upon the ear, and again returning like peals of thunder, and thus re-choed seven times

        <p>"Whilst we sat to regale, the barge put off from shore to a station where the finest
          echoes were to be obtained from the surrounding mountains. The vessel was provided with
          six brass cannon mounted on swivels;—on discharging one of these pieces, the report was
          echoed from the opposite rocks, where by reverberation it seemed to roll from cliff to
          cliff, and return through every cave and valley, till the decreasing tumult gradually died
          away upon the ear.</p>
        <p>——The instant it had ceased, the sound of every distant water-fall was heard, but for an
          instant only; for the momentary stillness was interrupted by the returning echo on the
          hills behind; where the report was repeated like a peal of thunder bursting over our
          heads, continuing for several seconds, flying from haunt to haunt, till once more the
          sound gradually declined;—again the voice of water-falls possessed the interval—till, to
          the right, the more distant thunder arose upon some other mountain, and seemed to take its
          way up every winding dell and creek, sometimes behind, on this side, or on that, in
          wondrous speed running its dreadful course; when the echo reached the mountains within the
          line and channel of the breeze, it was heard at once on the right and left, at the
          extremities of the lake.—In this manner was the report of every discharge re-echoed seven

          terrific grandeur of hanging rock. As you advance, a yawning chasm appears to divide it
          upwards from the base, and within it, is heard the hoarse noise of ingulphed waters. The
          tumult of cataracts and water-falls on all sides, adds much to the solemnity of these
          tremendous scenes. The path soon becomes winding, steep, and narrow, and is the only
          possible one across the mountain. The noise of a cataract on the left accompanies you
          during the ascent. On the summit of the mountain, you soon come in sight of <hi

        <p>Saving the few resident families, the life of this town is its being a thorough-fare. For
          although seated in the midst of a rich and fruitful country, no manufacturers have been
          induced to six here. Before the interest of the sister kingdoms became one, <placeName><w
            rend="italics">Penrith</w></placeName> was a place of uncertain tranquillity, and too precarious for
          the repose of trade and manual industry; being better circumstanced for a place of arms
          and military exercise. Yet since this happy change of circumstances, no more than one
          branch of tanning, and a small manufacture of checks have taken place. This must be owing
          either to want of attention in people of property, or of industry in the inhabitants. The
          latter is not to be supposed; for the spirit of agriculture, introduced by the gentlemen
          of the environs, is in as flourishing a way amongst the farmers of this neighbourhood, as
          in other parts of the kingdom. The superfluities of the market are bought up for <placeName><w
            rend="italics">Kendal</w></placeName>, where much of that produce is wanting which superabounds
          here.</p>
        <p>The most remarkable objects at <placeName><w rend="italics">Penrith</w></placeName> are the beacon, on the
          summit of the hill above the town, and the awful remains of a royal fortress, on the crest
          of the rising ground that commands the town. It is supposed to be an erection of <persName><w
            rend="italics">Henry</w> VI.</persName> out of the ruins of a more ancient structure called <placeName><w
            rend="italics">Mayburgh</w></placeName>; but this is not very probable, since stones are easier

        <p>got there. But as popular records have generally some fact to rest upon, and some truth
          in the bottom, so some facings and other principal stones taken from <placeName><w rend="italics"
            >Mayburgh</w></placeName>, might give rise to the tradition. There might also have been a strong
          hold here in the time of the <trait type="ethnicity">

          mutual intercourse of trade and alliance happily took place of national reprisals, and

          derivation, from <placeName><w rend="italics">Pen</w></placeName> and <placeName><w rend="italics">Rhudd</w></placeName>, signifying, in
          the language, a red head or hill; and such is the colour of the hill above the town, and
          the ground and stones around it. But, with respect to situation, it may as well be derived

        <p>In the church-yard are some sepulchral monuments, which have long been the subject of

          high; above that, they appear to be square, and to have terminated in a point. They are
          about ten feet high, stand parallel to the church, distant from each other fifteen feet.
          The space between is inclosed with circular stones, by some conjectured to represent
          boars. There remains visible, on the upper part of the pillars, some ornamental work, but
          no inscription or figures appear at present, and the stones are so much fretted by time,
          that it rests upon mere conjecture to affirm there ever were any. They probably mark the

        <p>of the road, soon after you leave the village, observe a double range of huge granites,
          pitched in the ground, and at some distance from each other, leading to circles of small
          stones, and encreasing the space between the rows as they approach the circles, where the
          avenue is about 27 paces wide. They are supposed to have run quite through the village,
          and terminated in a point. It has long embarrassed the antiquaries, what to call this very
          uncommon monument of ancient date. <persName>Mr. <w rend="italics">Pennant</w></persName> has given a plausible
          explanation of it from <hi rend="italics">Olaus Magnus</hi>, and supposes the rows of
          granites to be the recording stones of a Danish victory obtained on the spot, and the

        <p>There is at a small distance to the east from these stones a spring, called <placeName><w

        <p>"After crossing this dreary tract, the first appearance of a good country is most
          exquisitely fine; about three miles from <placeName><w rend="italics">Kendal</w></placeName>, you at once look
          down from off this desolate country upon one of the finest landscapes in the world; a
          noble range of fertile inclosures richly enamelled with most beautiful verdure: And coming
          to the brow of the hill have a most elegant picturesque view of a variegated tract of
          waving inclosures, spreading over hills, and hanging to the eye in the most picturesque
          and pleasing manner that fancy can conceive. Three hills in particular are overlooked, cut
          into inclosures in a charming stile, of themselves forming a most elegant landscape, and
          worthy the imitation of those who would give the embellishments of art to the simplicity
          of nature."</p>
        <p>The station from whence this description is taken, is about the midway between the third

            rend="italics">Stone-crag</w></placeName>, which cannot be mistaken. The three hills referred to in
          the description, are on the near ground of the landscape. There are many beautiful hills
          and knolls scattered about the valley; some cultivated, others covered with wood, or
          shining in the softest verdure. But the most remarkable one for picturesque form, is an
          oval green hill crowned with the ruins of a castle; it divides the valley, and overlooks a
          town hanging on the side of a steep mountain: This is</p>

        <p>The approach to it from the north is pleasant. A noble river, the <placeName><w rend="italics"
            >Kent</w></placeName>, is discovered flowing briskly through fertile fields, and visiting the town
          in its whole length. It is crossed by a bridge more venerable than handsome, where three
          great roads coincide, from <hi rend="italics"><placeName>Sedbergh</placeName>, <placeName>Kirkby-Stephen</placeName></hi>, and <placeName><w
            rend="italics">Penrith</w></placeName>. The main street leading from the bridge slopes upwards to
          the centre of the town, and contracts itself into an inconvenient passage, where it joins
          another principal street, which falls with a gentle declivity both ways, and is a mile in
          length, and of a spacious breadth. Was an area for a market-place opened at the incidence
          of these two streets, it would be a noble improvement. † The entrance from the south is by
          another bridge, which makes a short aukward turn into the sub-urbs, but after that, the
          street opens well, and the town has a chearful appearance.</p>
        <p>Here is a workhouse for the poor, which for neatness and aeconomy, exceeds most of the

        <p>The objects most worthy of notice here are the manufactures. The chief of these are of
          Kendal-cottons (a coarse woollen cloth,) of linseys, and of knit worsted stockings. Also a
          considerable tannery is carried on in this town. The lesser manufactures are, of
          fish-hooks, of waste silk (which is received from <placeName><w rend="italics">London</w></placeName>, and after
          scouring, combing, and spinning, is returned,) and of wool cards, in which branch
          considerable improvements have been made by the curious machines invented here for that
          purpose. There are other articles of industry well worth seeing; as the mills for
          scouring, fulling, and frizing cloth, for cutting and rasping dying wood, &amp;c. But what
          is most to the credit of this place, is, that notwithstanding many inconveniencies, which
          this town has ever laboured under, the manufactures have all along continued to flourish,
          and have of late years been greatly increased by the spirit and industry of the
          inhabitants. These manufactures are particularly noticed so early as the reign of <persName>King <w

        <p><persName>Mr. <w rend="italics">Gray</w></persName>'s description of this town is equally injurious to it and
          his memory; but his account of the church and castle is worth transcribing. "Near the end

          adjoining to it, the church, a very large gothic fabric, with a square tower; it has no
          particular ornaments, but double isles and at the east end four chapels or choirs." <persName>Mr. <w

          at <placeName><w rend="italics">Force-bridge</w></placeName>, and from the crown of it have a very singular
          romantic view of the river both ways, working its passage in a narrow deep channel of
          rocks, hanging over it in variety of forms, and streaming a thousand rills into the flood.
          The rocks in the bottom are strangely excavated into deep holes of various shapes, which
          when the river is low remain full of water, and from their depth are black as ink. The
          bridge is one bold arch, supported by the opposite rocks, of unknown antiquity. A mantle
          of ivy vails its ancient front, and gives it a most venerable appearance. If you ride down
          the west side of the river from the bridge, as far as the forge, to see the water-fall of
          the whole river, let it be remembered that the dream is much impaired in beauty since the
          forge was erected. And if, from the end of the uppermost house, you look up between two
          trees in the midst of the channel you will see the whole body of the river issuing from a
          fable cavern, and tumbling over a rock, of height just sufficient to convert it into froth
          as white as snow, and behind it, the arch of the bridge is partly catched in a disposition
          that forms a very uncommon assemblage of picturesque beauties. This is seen in highest
          perfection when the dream is full. Return to the bridge, and ride</p>

        <p>Here is one of the sweetest spots that fancy can imagine. The woods, the rocks, the
          river, the grounds, are rivals in beauty of stile, and variety of contrast. The bends of
          the river, the bulging of rocks over it, under which in some places it retires in haste,
          and again breaks out in a calm and spreading stream, are matchless beauties. The ground in
          some places is bold, and hangs abruptly over the river, or falls into gentle slopes, and
          easy plains. All is variety with pleasing transition. Thickets cover the brows; ancient
          thorns, and more ancient oaks, are scattered over the plain, and clumps, and solitary
          beach trees of enormous size, equal, if not surpass any thing the <placeName><w rend="italics"

          highest in <placeName><hi rend="italics">South Britain</hi></placeName>, yet below the point of permanent snow.
          It has been observed by the <roleName>French academicians</roleName>, that amongist the <placeName><w rend="italics"
            >Cordilleras</w></placeName>, in the province of <placeName><hi rend="italics">Quito, Petchincha</hi></placeName> and <placeName><w
            rend="italics">Carason</w></placeName>, are the highest accessible mountains, and that all of
          greater heights are vested with eternal snow.</p>
        <p>On the <w rend="italics">Glacieres</w> snow is permanent at a much inferior height; and
          where the sun's rays fall more obliquely, less height is found the boundary between
          temporary and eternal snow. But no mountain in <placeName><hi rend="italics">South Britain</hi></placeName>
          touches the zone of barrenness, that intervenes between this region and the limits of

        <p>IN my way to the north from <placeName><w rend="italics">Hagley</w></placeName>, I passed thro' <placeName><w
            rend="italics">Dovedale</w></placeName>; and to say the truth, was disappointed in it. When I came
          to <placeName><w rend="italics">Buxton</w></placeName>, I visited another or two of their romantic scenes; but
          these are inferior to <placeName><w rend="italics">Dovedale</w></placeName>. They are but poor miniatures of <placeName><w
            rend="italics">Keswick</w></placeName>; which exceeds them more in grandeur than I can give you to
          imagine; and more, if possible, in beauty than in grandeur.</p>
        <p>Instead of the narrow slip of valley which is seen at <placeName><w rend="italics">Dovedale</w></placeName>, you
          have at <placeName><w rend="italics">Keswick</w></placeName> a vast amphitheatre, in circumference above twenty
          miles. Instead of a meagre rivulet, a noble living lake, ten miles round, of an oblong
          form, adorned with a variety of wooded islands. The rocks indeed of <placeName><w rend="italics"

        <p>are finely wild, pointed, and irregular; but the hills are both little and unanimated;
          and the margin of the brook is poorly edged with weeds, morass, and brushwood.—But at <placeName><w
            rend="italics">Keswick</w></placeName>, you will on one side of the lake, see a rich and beautiful
          landscape of cultivated fields, rising to the eye, in fine inequalities, with noble groves
          of oak, happily dispersed, and climbing the adjacent hills, shade above shade, in the most
          various and picturesque forms. On the opposite shore you will find rocks and cliffs of
          stupendous height, hanging broken over the lake in horrible grandeur, some of them a
          thousand feet high, the woods climbing up their steep and shaggy sides, where mortal foot
          never yet approached. On these dreadful heights the eagles build their nests; a variety of
          water-falls are seen pouring from their summits, and tumbling in vast sheets from rock to
          rock in rude and terrible magnificence: while on all sides of this immense amphitheatre
          the lofty mountains rise round, piercing the clouds in shapes as spiry and fantastic, as
          the very rocks of <placeName><w rend="italics">Dovedale</w></placeName>.—To this I must add the frequent and bold
          projection of the cliffs into the lake, forming noble bays and promontories: in other
          parts they finely retire from it, and often open in abrupt chasms or clefts, thro' which
          at hand, you see rich and cultivated vales, and beyond these at various distances,
          mountain rising over mountain, among which, new prospects present themselves in mist, till
          the eye is lost in an agreeable perplexity:</p>
        <lg>
          <l>Where active fancy travels beyond sense,</l>
          <l>And pictures things unseen---------</l>
        </lg>
        <p>Were I to analyse the two places into their constituent principles, I should tell you,
          that the full perfection of <placeName><w rend="italics">Keswick</w></placeName>, consists of three
          circumstances, <hi rend="italics">beauty, horror</hi>, and <w rend="italics">immensity</w>
          united; the second of which is alone found in <placeName><w rend="italics">Dovedale</w></placeName>. Of beauty it
          hath little: nature having left it almost a desart: neither its small extent, nor the
          diminutive and lifeless form of the hills admit magnificence.—But to give you a complete
          idea of these three perfections, as they are joined in <placeName><w rend="italics">Keswick</w></placeName>,
          would require the united powers of <hi rend="italics"><persName>Claude</persName>, Sal</hi>-</p>

        <p><w rend="italics">vator</w>, and <persName><w rend="italics">Poussin</w></persName>. The first should throw
          his delicate sunshine over the cultivated vales, the scattered cots, the groves, the lake,
          and wooded islands. The second should dash out the horror os the rugged cliffs, the
          steeps, the hanging woods, and foaming water-falls; while the grand pencil of Poussin
          should crown the whole with the majesty of the impending mountains.</p>
        <p>So much for what I would call the <w rend="italics">permanent</w> beauties of this
          astonishing scene. Were I not afraid of being tiresome, I could now dwell as long on its
            <w rend="italics">varying</w> or <w rend="italics">accidental</w> beauties. I would fail
          round the lake, anchor in every bay, and land you on every promontory and island. I would
          point out the perpetual change of prospect: the woods, rocks, cliffs, and mountains, by
          turns vanishing or rising into view: now gaining on the sight, hanging over our heads in
          their full dimensions, beautifully dreadful; and now by a change of situation, assuming
          new romantic shapes, retiring and lessening on the eye, and insensibly losing themselves
          in an azure mist. I would remark the contrast of light and shade, produced by the morning
          and evening fun; the one gilding the western and the other the eastern side of this
          immense amphitheatre while the vast shadow projected by the mountains buries the opposite
          part in a deep and purple gloom, which the eye can hardly penetrate: the natural variety
          of colouring which the several objects produce is no less wonderful and pleasing; the
          ruling tints in the valley being those of azure, green, and gold, yet ever various,
          arising from an intermixture of the lake, the woods, the grass, and corn-fields: these are
          finely contrasted by the grey rocks and cliffs; and the whole heightened by the yellow
          streams of light, the purple hues; and misty azure of the mountains. Sometimes a serene
          air and clear sky disclose the tops of the highest hills: at others you see the clouds
          involving their summits, resting on their sides, or descending to their base, and rolling
          among the vallies, as in a vast furnace.—When the winds are high, they roar among the
          cliffs and caverns, like a peal of thunder;</p>

        <p>then too the clouds are seen in vast bodies sweeping along the hills in gloomy greatness,
          while the lake joins the tumult and tosses like a sea. But in calm weather the whole scene
          becomes new: the lake is a perfect mirror; and the landscape in all its beauty, islands,
          fields, woods, rocks, and mountains are seen inverted and floating on its surface.—I will
          now carry you to the top os a cliff, where if you dare approach the ridge, a new scene of
          astonishment presents itself, where the valley, lake, and islands, seem lying at your
          feet, where this expanse of water appears diminished to a little pool amidst the vast
          immeasurable objects that surround it; for here the summits of more distant hills appear
          beyond those you had already seen; and rising behind each other in successive ranges and
          azure groups of craggy and broken steeps, form an immense and awful picture, which can
          only be expressed by the image of a tempestuous sea of mountains.—Let me now conduct you
          down again, to the valley, and conclude with one circumstance more, which is, that a walk
          by still moonlight (at which time the distant water-falls are heard in all their variety
          of sound) among these inchanting dales, opens a scene of such delicate beauty, repose, and
          solemnity, as exceeds all description</p>

        <p>I Hope you got safe and well home after that troublesome night.* I long to hear you say
          so. For me I have continued well, been so savoured by the weather, that my walks have
          never once been hindered till yesterday (that is a fortnight and three or four days, and a
          journey of more than 300 miles.) I am now at <placeName><w rend="italics">Aston</w></placeName> for two days.
          To-morrow I go to <hi rend="italics"><placeName>Cambridge</placeName>. <persName>Mason</persName></hi> is not here; but <persName>Mr. <w
            rend="italics">Alderson</w></persName> receives me. According to my promise, I send you the first

        <p>* <persName>Dr. <w rend="italics">Wharton</w></persName>, who had intended to accompany <persName>Mr. <w rend="italics"
            >Gray</w></persName> to <placeName><w rend="italics">Keswick</w></placeName>, was seized at <placeName><w rend="italics">Brough</w></placeName>
          with a violent fit of his asthma, which obliged him to return home. This was the reason
          that <placeName>Mr. <w rend="italics">Gray</w></placeName> undertook to write the following journal of his tour
          for his friend's amusement. He sent it under different covers; I give it here in
          continuation. It may not be amiss, however, to hint to the reader, that if he expects to
          find elaborate and nicely turned periods in this narration, he will be greatly
          disappointed. When <persName>Mr. <w rend="italics">Gray</w></persName> described places, he aimed only to be
          exact, clear, and intelligible; to convey peculiar, not general deas, and to paint by the
          eye, not the fancy. There have been many accounts of the <placeName><w rend="italics">Westmorland</w></placeName>
          and <placeName><w rend="italics">Cumberland</w></placeName> lakes, both before and since this was written, and
          all of them better calculated to please readers, who are fond of what they call fine
          writing: Yet those who can content themselves with an elegant simplicity of narrative,
          will, I flatter myself, find this to their taste; they will perceive it was written with a
          view, rather to inform than surprise; and, is they make it their companion when they take
          the same tour, it will enhance their opinion of its intrinsic excellence; in this way I
          tried it myself before I resolved to print it.</p>

        <p><w rend="italics">Sep.</w> 30. A mile and a half from <placeName><w rend="italics">Brough</w></placeName>, where
          we parted, on a hill lay a great army* encamped: To the left opened a fine valley with
          green meadows and hedge-rows, a gentleman's house peeping forth from a grove of old trees.
          On a nearer approach appeared myriads of cattle and horses in the road itself, and in all
          the fields round me, a brisk stream hurrying cross the way, thousands of clean healthy
          people in their best party-coloured apparel: Farmers and their families, esquires and
          their daughters hastening up from the dales and down the fells from every quarter,
          glittering in the sun, and pressing forward to join the throng. While the dark hills, on
          whose tops the mists were yet hanging, served as a contrast to this gay and moving scene,
          which continued for near two miles more along the road, and the crowd (coming towards it)
          reached on as for as <placeName><w rend="italics">Appleby</w></placeName>. On the ascent of the hill above <placeName><w

          the castle and town, gave much employment to the mirror: † but now the fun was wanting and
          the sky overcast. Oats and barley cut every where, but not carried in. Passed <placeName><w

        <p>hundred nameless hills : These lie to the west and south. To the north, a great extent of
          black and dreary plains. To the east, Cross-fell, just visible through mists and vapours
          hovering round it.</p>
        <p><w rend="italics">Oct</w>. 1. A grey autumnal day, the air perfectly calm, and mild, went
          to see <placeName><w rend="italics">Ulls-water</w></placeName>, five miles distant; soon left the <placeName><w
            rend="italics">Keswick</w></placeName> road, and turned to the left, through shady lanes along the
          vale of <placeName><w rend="italics">Emont</w></placeName>, which runs rapidly on near the way ripling over the
          stones; to the right is <placeName><w rend="italics">Dalemain</w></placeName>, a large fabrick of pale red stone,
          with nine windows in front and seven on the side, built by <persName>Mr. <w rend="italics"
            >Hassell</w></persName>; behind it a fine lawn surrounded by woods, and a long rocky eminence
          rising over them: A clear and brisk rivulet runs by the house to join the <placeName><w
            rend="italics">Emont</w></placeName>, whose course is in sight and at a small distance. Further on
          appears <placeName><hi rend="italics">Hutton St. John</hi></placeName>, a castle-like old mansion of <persName>Mr. <w
            rend="italics">Huddleston</w></persName>. Approached <placeName><w rend="italics">Dunmallet</w></placeName>, a fine
          pointed hill covered with wood, planted by old <persName>Mr. <w rend="italics">Hassell</w></persName> before
          mentioned, who lives always at home, and delights in planting. Walked over a spongy meadow
          or two, and began to mount the hill through a broad straight green alley among the trees,
          and with some toil gained the summit. From hence saw the lake opening directly at my feet,
          majestic in its calmness, clear and smooth as a blue mirror, with winding shores and low
          points of land covered with green inclosures, white farm houses looking out among the
          trees, and cattle feeding. The water is almost every where bordered with cultivated lands,
          gently sloping upwards from a mile to a quarter of a mile in breadth, till they reach the
          feet of the mountains, which rise very rude and awful with their broken tops on either
          hand. Directly in front at better than three miles distance, <placeName><w rend="italics"
            >Place-fell</w></placeName>, one of the bravest among them, pushes its bold broad breast into the
          midst of the lake, and forces it to alter its course, forming first a large bay to the
          left, and then bending to the right. I descended <placeName><w rend="italics">Dunmallet</w></placeName> again by
          a side avenue, that was only not perpendicular, and came to <placeName><w rend="italics"

        <p>of the hill, came forth where the <placeName><w rend="italics">Emont</w></placeName> issues out of the lake, and
          continued my way along its western shore close to the water, and generally on a level with
          it. Saw a cormorant flying over it and fishing. The figure of the lake nothing resembles
          that laid down in our maps: It is nine miles long; and at widest under a mile in breadth.
          After extending itself three miles and a half in a line to south-west, it turns at the
          foot of <placeName><w rend="italics">Place-fell</w></placeName> almost due west, and is here not twice the
          breadth of the <placeName><w rend="italics">Thames</w></placeName> at <placeName><w rend="italics">London</w></placeName>. It is soon
          again interrupted by the root of <placeName><w rend="italics">Helvellyn</w></placeName>, a lofty and very rugged
          mountain, and spreading again turns off to the south-east, and is lost among the deep
          recesses of the hills. To this second turning I pursued my way about four miles along its
          border beyond a village scattered among trees, and called <placeName><w rend="italics"
            >Watermillock</w></placeName>, in a pleasant grave day, perfectly calm and warm, but without a gleam
          of sunshine; then the sky seeming to thicken, and the valley to grow more desolate, and

          which lie about three miles from <placeName><w rend="italics">Ulls-water</w></placeName> over the fells; passed
          through <placeName><w rend="italics">Penruddock</w></placeName> and <placeName><w rend="italics">Threlkeld</w></placeName> at the foot
          of <placeName><w rend="italics">Saddle-back</w></placeName>, whose furrowed sides were gilt by the noon-day fun,
          whilst its brow appeared of a sad purple from the shadow of the clouds as they sailed
          slowly by it. The broad and green valley of <placeName><w rend="italics">Gardies</w></placeName> and <placeName><w
            rend="italics">Lowside</w></placeName>, with a swift stream glittering among the cottages and

          conduct of my landlord to <placeName><w rend="italics">Borrowdale</w></placeName>; the grass was covered with a
          hoar-frost, which soon melted and exhaled in a thin bluish smoke; crossed the meadows,
          obliquely catching a diversity of views among the hills over the lake and islands, and
          changing prospect at every ten paces. Left <placeName><w rend="italics">Cochshut</w></placeName> (which we

          rocky brow cut perpendicularly down above 400 feet (as I guess, though the people called
          it much more) awfully overlooks the way. Our path here tends to the left, and the ground
          gently rising and covered with a glade of scattering trees and bushes on the very margin
          of the water, opens both ways the most delicious view that my eyes ever beheld. Opposite

          now to impend terribly over your way, and more terribly when you hear that three years
          since an immense mass of rock tumbled at once from the brow, and barred all access to the
          dale (for this is the only road) till they could work their way through it. Luckily no one
          was passing by at the time of this fall; but down the side of the mountain, and far into
          the lake, lie dispersed the huge fragments of this ruin in all shapes and in all
          directions; Something farther we turned aside into a coppice, ascending a little in front
          of <placeName><w rend="italics">Lowdore</w></placeName> water-fall; the height appeared to be about 200 feet, the
          quantity of water not great, though (these three days excepted) it had rained daily in the
          hills for near two months before: But then the stream was nobly broken, leaping from rock
          to rock, and foaming with fury. On one side a towering crag that spired up to equal, if
          not overtop the neighbouring cliffs (this lay all in shade and darkness:) On the other
          hand a rounder, broader, projecting hill, shagged with wood, and illuminated by the sun,
          which glanced sideways on the upper part of the cataract. The force of the water wearing a
          deep channel in the ground, hurries away to join the lake. We descended again and passed
          the stream over a rude bridge. Soon after we came under <placeName><w rend="italics">Gowdar-crag</w></placeName>,
          a hill more formidable to the eye, and to the apprehension, than that of <placeName><w rend="italics"

          passes in the <w rend="italics">Alps</w>, where the guides tell you to move on with speed,
          and say nothing, lest the agitation of the air should loosen the snows above, and bring
          down a mass that would overwhelm a caravan. I took their counsel here and hastened on in

          some of it has been cut forty years ago, some within these eight years; yet all is sprung
          again, green, flourishing, and tall, for its age, in a place where no foil appears but the
          staring rock, and where a man could scarce stand upright: Here we met a civil young <roleName>farmer</roleName>
          overseeing his reapers (for it is now oat harvest) who conducted us to a neat white house
          in the village of <placeName><w rend="italics">Grange</w></placeName>, which is built on a rising ground in the
          midst of a valley; round it the mountains form an awful amphitheatre, and through it
          obliquely runs the <placeName><w rend="italics">Derwent</w></placeName>, clear as glass, and shewing under its
          bridge every trout that passes. Beside the village rises a round eminence of a rock
          covered intirely with old trees, and over that more proudly towers <placeName><w rend="italics"
            >Castle-crag</w></placeName>, invested also with wood on its sides, and bearing on its naked top
            some traces of a fort, said to be <trait type="ethnicity">
              <label>Roman</label>
            </trait>. By the side of this hill, which almost blocks up
          the way, the valley turns to the left and contracts its dimensions till there is hardly
          any road but the rocky bed of the river. The wood of the mountains increases, and their
          summits grow loftier to the eye, and of more fantastic forms; among them appear <hi

        <p>For me, I went no farther than the farmer's (better than four miles from <placeName><w

          dish, bowls of milk, thin oaten-cakes and ale; and we had carried a cold tongue thither
          with us. Our <roleName>farmer</roleName> was himself the man that last year plundered the eagle's eyrie; all
          the dale are up in arms on such an occasion, for they lose abundance of lambs yearly, not
          to mention hares, partridges, grouse, &amp;c. He was let down from the cliff in ropes to
          the shelf of the rock on which the nest was built, the people above shouting and hallooing
          to fright the old birds, which flew screaming round, but did not dare to attack him. He
          brought off the eaglet (for there is rarely more than one) and an addle egg. The nest was
          roundish, and more than a yard over, made of twigs twisted together. Seldom a year passes
          but they take the brood or eggs, and sometimes they shoot one, sometimes the other,
          parent; but the survivor has always found a mate (probably in <placeName><w rend="italics"
            >Ireland</w></placeName>) and they breed near the old place. By his description I learn that this
          species is the <w rend="italics">Erne</w>, the vulture <w rend="italics">Abicilla</w> of

        <p>We returned leisurely home the way we came, but saw a new landscape; the features indeed
          were the same in part, but many new ones were disclosed by the mid day sun, and the tints
          were intirely changed; take notice this was the best, or perhaps the only day for going up

          the night draw on, the last gleam of sunshine fading away on the hill tops, the deep
          serene of the waters, and the long shadows of the mountains thrown across them, till they
          nearly touched the hithermost shore. At a distance were heard the murmurs of many
          water-falls, not audible in the day-time; I wished for the moon; but she was dark to me

        <p><label><date><w rend="italics">Oct</w>. 4.</date></label> I walked to <placeName><w rend="italics">Crow-park</w></placeName>, now a rough
          pasture, once a glade of ancient oaks, whose large roots still remain in the ground, but
          nothing has sprung from them. If one single tree had remained, this would have been an
          unparallel'd spot; and <persName><w rend="italics">Smith</w></persName> judged right when he took his print of
          the lake from hence, for it is a gentle eminence, not too high, on the very margin of the
          water, and commanding it from end to end, looking full into the gorge of <placeName><w rend="italics"
            >Borrowdale</w></placeName>. I prefer it even to <placeName><w rend="italics">Cockshut-hill</w></placeName> which lies
          beside it, and to which I walked in the afternoon; it is covered with young trees both
          sown and planted, oak, spruce, Scotch-fir, &amp;c. all which thrive wonderfully. There is
          an easy ascent to the top, and the view far preferable to that on <placeName><w rend="italics"
            >Castle-hill</w></placeName> (which you remember) because this is lower and nearer to the lake; for
          I find all points that are much elevated, spoil the beauty of the valley, and make its
          parts, which are not large, look poor and diminutive.* While I was here a little shower
          fell, red clouds</p>
        <p>came</p>
        <p>* The picturesque point is always thus low in all prospects: A truth, which though the
          landscape painter knows, he cannot always observe, since the patron who employs him to
          take a view of his place, usually carries him to some elevation for that purpose, in
          order, I suppose, that he may have more of him for his money. Yet when I say this, I would
          not be thought to mean that a drawing should be made from the lowest point possible; as
          for instance, in this very view, from the lake itself, for then a fore-ground would be
          wanting. On this account, when I failed on <placeName><w rend="italics">Derwent-water</w></placeName>, I did not
          receive so much pleasure from the superb amphitheatre of mountains around me, as when,
          like <persName>Mr. <w rend="italics">Gray</w></persName>, I traversed its margin; and therefore think he did
          not lose much by not taking boat.</p>

          that if I could transmit to you, and fix it in all the softness of its living colours,
          would fairly sell for a thousand pounds. This is the sweetest scene I can yet discover in

          mass of crumbling slate. Passed round its foot between trees and the edge of the water,

        <p>season, because of the great variety of soils and elevations, all lying within a small
          compass. I observed nothing but several curious lichens, and plenty of gale or Dutch
          myrtle perfuming the borders of the lake. This year the wad-mine had been opened, which is
          done once in five years; it is taken out in lumps sometimes as big as a man's fist, and
          will undergo no preparation by fire, not being fusible; when it is pure, soft, black, and
          loose-grained, it is worth sometimes thirty shillings a pound. There are no char ever
          taken in these lakes, but plenty in <placeName><w rend="italics">Buttermere-water</w></placeName>, which lies a
          little way north of <placeName><w rend="italics">Borrowdale</w></placeName>, about Martinmas, which are potted
          here. They sow chiefly oats and bigg here, which are now cutting and still on the ground;
          the rains have done much hurt: yet observe, the soil is so thin and light, that no day has
          passed in which I could not walk out with ease; and you know I am no lover of dirt. Fell
          mutton is now in season for about six weeks; it grows fat on the mountains, and nearly
          resembles venison. Excellent pike and perch, here called bass: Trout is now out of season;
          partridge in great plenty.</p>
        <p><label><date><w rend="italics">Oct</w>. 8.</date></label> I left <placeName><w rend="italics">Keswick</w></placeName>, and took the <placeName><w
            rend="italics">Ambleside</w></placeName> road in a gloomy morning; and about two * miles from the
          town mounted an eminence called <placeName><w rend="italics">Castle-rig</w></placeName>, and the sun breaking
          out, discovered the most inchanting view I have yet seen of the whole valley behind me,
          the two lakes, the river, the mountains all in their glory; so that I had almost a mind to
          have gone back again. The road in some few parts is not completed, yet good country road,
          through found but narrow and stony lanes, very safe in broad day light. This is the case
          about <placeName><w rend="italics">Causeway-foot</w></placeName>, and among <placeName><w rend="italics">Naddle-fells</w></placeName> to
            <placeName><w rend="italics">Langthwaite</w></placeName>. The vale you go in has little breadth; the mountains
          are vast and rocky, the fields little and poor, and the inhabitants are now making hay,
          and see not the sun by two hours in a day so long as at <placeName><w rend="italics">Keswick</w></placeName>.
          Came to the foot of <placeName><w rend="italics">Helvellyn</w></placeName>, along which runs an excellent road,

            rend="italics">Thirlmere</w></placeName>, or <placeName><w rend="italics">Wythhurn-water</w></placeName>) and soon
          descending on its margin. The lake looks black from its depth, and from the gloom of the
          vast crags that scowl over it, though really clear as glass; it is narrow, and about three
          miles long, resembling a river in its course; little shining torrents hurrying down the
          rocks to join it, but not a bush to overshadow them, or cover their march; all is rock and
          loose stones up to the very brow, which lies so near your way, that not above half the
          height of <placeName><w rend="italics">Helvellyn</w></placeName> can be seen.</p>
        <p>Next I passed by the little chapel of <placeName><w rend="italics">Wythhurn</w></placeName>, out of which the
          sunday congregation were then issuing; soon after a beck near <placeName><w rend="italics"
            >Dunmail-raise</w></placeName>, where I entered <placeName><w rend="italics">Westmorland</w></placeName> a second time; and
          now began to see <placeName><w rend="italics">Helm-crag</w></placeName>, distinguished from its rugged
          neighbours, not so much by its height as by the strange broken outlines of its top, like
          some gigantic building demolished, and the stones that composed it flung across each other
          in wild confusion. Just beyond it, opens one of the sweetest landscapes that art ever
          attempted to imitate. The bosom of the mountains spreading here into a broad bason
          discovers in the midst <placeName><w rend="italics">Grasmere-water</w></placeName>; its margin is hollowed into
          small bays, with bold eminences; some of rock some of turf, that half-conceal, and vary
          the figure of the little lake they command: from the shore, a low promontory pushes itself
          far into the water, and on it stands a white village with the parish church rising in the
          midst of it: hanging inclosures, corn-fields and meadows green as an emerald, with their
          trees and hedges, and cattle, fill up the whole space from the edge of the water: And just
          opposite to you is a large farm-house at the bottom of a steep smooth lawn, embosomed in
          old woods which climb half way up the mountains side, and discover above them a broken
          line of crags that crown the scene. Not a single red tile, no gentlemen's flaring house,
          or garden walls break in upon the repose of this little unsuspected paradise; but all is
          peace, rusticity, and happy poverty, in its neatest most becoming attire.</p>

        <p>The road winds here over <placeName><w rend="italics">Grasmere</w> hill</placeName>, whose rocks soon conceal
          the water from your sight; yet it is continued along behind them, and contracting itself
          to a river, communicates with <placeName><w rend="italics">Rydal-water</w></placeName>, another small lake, but
          of inferior size and beauty; it seems shallow too, for large patches of reeds appear
          pretty far within it. Into this vale the road descends. On the opposite banks large and
          ancient woods mount up the hill; and just to the left of our way stands <placeName><w rend="italics"
            >Rydal-hall</w></placeName>, the family seat of <persName>Sir <hi rend="italics">Michael le Fleming</hi></persName>, a
          large old-fashioned fabrick, rounded with wood. <persName>Sir <w rend="italics">Michael</w></persName> is now
          on his travels, and all this timber far and wide belongs to him. Near the house rises a
          huge crag, called <placeName><w rend="italics">Rydal-head</w></placeName>, which is said to command a full view
          of <placeName><w rend="italics">Windermere</w></placeName>, and I doubt it not; for within a mile, that lake is
          visible even from the road: as to going up the crag, one might as well go up <placeName><w
            rend="italics">Skiddaw</w></placeName>.</p>
        <p>I now reached <placeName><w rend="italics">Ambleside</w></placeName>, sixteen miles from <placeName><w rend="italics"
            >Keswick</w></placeName>, meaning to lie there: but on looking into the best bedchamber, dark and
          damp as a cellar, grew delicate, gave up <placeName><w rend="italics">Windermere</w></placeName> in despair, and
          resolved I would go on to <placeName><w rend="italics">Kendal</w></placeName> directly fourteen miles farther.*
          The road in general, fine turnpike,</p>

            >Gray</w></persName> lost the sight of two magnificent cascades: the one not half a mile behind the
          inn, the other down <placeName><w rend="italics">Rydal-crag</w></placeName>, where <persName>Sir <hi rend="italics">Michael
            le Fleming</hi></persName> is now making a pathway to the top of it. These, when I saw them, were
          in full torrent. whereas <placeName><w rend="italics">Lowdore</w> water-fall</placeName> which I visited in the
          evening of the very same day, was almost without a stream. Hence I conclude that this
          distinguished feature in <placeName>the vale of <w rend="italics">Keswick</w></placeName>, is like most of the
          northern rivers, only in high beauty during bad weather. But his greatest loss was in not
          seeing a small water-fall, visible only through the window of a ruined summer-house in <persName>Sir
            <w rend="italics">Michael</w></persName>'s orchard. Here nature has performed every thing in little
          that she usually executes on her larger scale; and on that account, like the miniature
          painter, seems to have finished every part of it in a studied manner; not a little
          fragment of rock thrown into the bason, not a single stem of brushwood that starts from
          its cragey sides but has its picturesque meaning; and the little central stream dashing
          down a cleit of the darkest coloured stone, produces an effect of light and shadow
          beautiful beyond description. This little theatrical scene might be painted as large as
          the original, on a canvas not bigger than those usually dropped in the opera-house.</p>

        <p>but some parts (about three miles in all) not made, yet without danger.</p>
        <p>For this determination I was unexpectedly well rewarded: for the afternoon was fine, and
          the road, for the space of full five miles, ran along the side of <placeName><w rend="italics"
            >Windermere</w></placeName>, with delicious views across it, and almost from one end to the other.
          It is ten miles in length, and at most a mile over, resembling the course of some vast and
          magnificent river; but no flat marshy grounds, no osier-beds, or patches of scrubby
          plantations on its banks: at the head two vallies open among the mountains; one, that by
          which we came down, the other <placeName><w rend="italics">Langdale</w></placeName>, in which <placeName><w rend="italics"
            >Wrynose</w></placeName> and <placeName><w rend="italics">Hardknot</w></placeName>, two great mountains, rise above the
          rest: From thence the fells visibly sink, and soften along its sides; sometimes they run
          into it (but with a gentle declivity) in their own dark and natural complexion: oftener
          they are green and cultivated, with farms interspersed, and round eminences, on the border
          covered with trees: towards the south it seemed to break into large bays, with several
          islands and a wider extent of cultivation. The way rises continually, till at a place
          called <placeName><w rend="italics">Orrest-head</w></placeName> it turns south-east, losing sight of the
          water.</p>
        <p>Passed by <placeName><w rend="italics">Ings</w> chapel</placeName> and <placeName><w rend="italics">Staveley</w></placeName>; but I can
          say no farther, for the dusk of the evening coming on, I entered <placeName><w rend="italics"
            >Kendal</w></placeName> almost in the dark, and could distinguish only a shadow of the castle on a
          hill, and tenter grounds spread far and wide round the town, which I mistook for houses.
          My inn promised sadly, having two wooden galleries, like <placeName><w rend="italics">Scotland</w></placeName>,
          in front of it; it was indeed an old ill-contrived house, but kept by civil sensible
          people; so I stayed two nights with them, and fared and slept very comfortably.</p>

        <p>three nearly parallel streets, almost a mile long; except these, all the other houses
          seem as is they had been dancing a country-dance, and were out: there they stand back to
          back, corner to corner, some up-hill, some down, without intent or meaning. Along by their
          side runs a fine brisk stream, over which there are three stone bridges; the buildings (a
          few comfortable houses excepted) are mean, of stone, and covered with a bad rough-cast. *
          Near the end of the town stands a handsome house of <persName>Colonel <w rend="italics"

          tower: it has no particular ornaments but double ayles, and at the east end four chapels
          or choirs; one of the <persName><w rend="italics">Parrs</w></persName>, another of the <persName><w rend="italics"
            >Stricklands</w></persName>; the third is the proper choir of the church, and the fourth of the <w

          them dated 1577, with a flat brass arms and quarterings; and in the window their arms
          alone, arg. a hunting horn sab. strung gules. In the <persName><w rend="italics">Strickland</w></persName>'s
          chapel several monuments, and another old altar tomb, not belonging to the family: On the

            >Parr</w></persName>'s chapel is a third altar tomb in the corner, no figure or inscription, but on

          on the side of the river opposite the town; almost the whole inclosure of the walls
          remains, with four towers, two square, and two round, but their upper parts and
          embattlements are demolished: It is of rough stone and cement, without any ornament or
          arms, round, inclosing a court of like form, and surrounded by a moat; nor ever could it
          have been larger than it is, for there are no traces of outworks. There is a good view of
          the town and river, with a fertile open valley through which it winds.</p>
        <p>After dinner I went along the <placeName><w rend="italics">Millthrop</w></placeName> turnpike, four miles, to
          see the falls, or force of the river <placeName><w rend="italics">Kent</w></placeName>; came to <placeName><w rend="italics"
            >Sizergh</w></placeName>, (pronounced <w rend="italics">Siser</w>) and turned down a lane to the
          left. This seat of the <persName><w rend="italics">Stricklands</w></persName>, an old catholick family, is an
          ancient hall-house, with a very large tower embattled; the rest of the buildings added to
          it are of a later date, but all is white, and seen to advantage on a back-ground of old
          trees; there is a small park also well wooded. Opposite to this, turning to the left, I
          soon came to the river; it works its way in a narrow and deep rocky channel overhung with
          trees. The calmness and brightness of the evening, the roar of the waters, and the
          thumping of huge hammers at an iron-forge not far distant, made it a singular walk; but as
          to the falls (for there are two) they are not four feet high. I went on down to the forge,
          and saw the demons at work by the light of their own fires: The iron is brought in pigs to

        <p>some common interspersed. Passed at the foot of <placeName><w rend="italics">Farlton-knot</w></placeName>, a
          high fell. Four miles north of <placeName><w rend="italics">Lancaster</w></placeName>, on a rising ground, called
            <placeName><w rend="italics">Bolton</w></placeName> (pronounced <w rend="italics">Bouton</w>) we had a full
          view of <placeName><w rend="italics">Cartmel</w></placeName> sands, with here and there a <roleName>passenger</roleName> riding over
          them (it being low water;) the points of <placeName><w rend="italics">Furness</w></placeName> shooting far into
          the sea, and lofty mountains, partly covered with clouds, extending north of them. <placeName><w
            rend="italics">Lancaster</w></placeName> also appeared very conspicuous and fine; for its most
          distinguished features, the castle and church, mounted on a green eminence, were all that
          could be seen. Woe is me! when I got thither, it was the second day of their fair; the
          inn, in the principal street, was a great old gloomy house full of people; but I found
          tolerable quarters, and even slept two nights in peace.</p>
        <p>In a fine afternoon I amended the castle-hill; it takes up the higher top of the eminence
          on which it stands, and is irregularly round, encompassed with a deep moat: In front,
          towards the town, is a magnificent gothic gateway, lofty and huge; the overhanging
          battlements are supported by a triple range of corbels, the intervals pierced through and
          shewing the day from above. On its top rise light watch towers of small height. It opens
          below with a grand pointed arch; over this is a wrought tabernacle, doubtless once
          containing its founder's figure; on one side a shield of <placeName><w rend="italics">France</w></placeName>
          semy-quartered with <placeName><w rend="italics">England</w></placeName>: on the other the same, with a label,
          ermine, for <persName><hi rend="italics">John of Gaunt</hi>, Duke of <w rend="italics"
          >Lancaster</w></persName>. This opens to a court within, which I did not much care to enter, being
          the county goal, and full of prisoners, both <roleName>criminals</roleName> and <roleName>debtors</roleName>. From this gateway the
          walls continue and join it to a vast square tower of great height, the lower part at least
          of remote antiquity; for it has small round-headed lights with plain short pillars on each
          side of them: There is a third tower, also square and of less dimensions. This is all the
          castle. Near it, and but little lower, stands the church, a large and plain Gothic fabric,
          the high square tower at the west end has been rebuilt of late years, but nearly in the
          same stile; There are no ornaments of arms, &amp;c.</p>

          antiquity, or piece of painted glass is left. From the church-yard there is an extensive
          sea-view, (for now the tide had almost covered the sands, and filled the river) and
          besides the greatest part of <placeName><w rend="italics">Furness</w></placeName>, I could distinguish <placeName><w

          off its southern extremity. The town is built on the slope, and at the foot of the
          castle-hill, more than twice the bigness of <placeName><w rend="italics">Auckland</w></placeName>, with many neat
          buildings of white stone, but a little disorderly in their position, and "ad libitum,"
          like <placeName><w rend="italics">Kendal</w></placeName>: Many also extend below on the keys by the river side,
          where a number of ships were moored, some of them three masted vessels decked out with
          their colours in honour of the fair. Here is a good bridge of four arches over the <placeName><w
            rend="italics">Lune</w></placeName>, that runs, when the tide is out, in two streams divided by a
          bed of gravel, which is not covered but in spring tides; below the town it widens to near
          the breadth of the <placeName><w rend="italics">Thames</w></placeName> at <placeName><w rend="italics">London</w></placeName>, and meets
          the sea at five or six miles distance to south-west.</p>

          miles, to the village of <placeName><w rend="italics">Poulton</w></placeName>, which stands on the beach. An <roleName>old
          fisherman</roleName> mending his nets (while I enquired about the danger of pasting those sands) told
          me, in his dialect, a moving story; how a brother of the trade, a <placeName><w rend="italics"
            >Cockler</w></placeName>, as he stilled him, driving a little cart with two daughters (women grown)
          in it, and his wife on horseback following, set out one day to pass the seven-mile sands,
          as they had been frequently used to do; (for nobody in the village knew them better than
          the old man did) when they were about half-way over, a thick fog rose, and as they
          advanced they found the water much deeper than they expected: the old man was puzzled; he
          stopped, and said he would go a little way to find some mark he was acquainted with; they
          staid a while for him, but in vain; they called aloud, but no reply: at last the young
          women pressed their mother to think where they were, and go on; she would not leave the
          place; she wandered about</p>

        <p>forlorn and amazed; she would not quit her horse and get into the cart with them: they
          determined, after much time wasted, to turn back, and give themselves up to the guidance
          of their horses. The old woman was soon washed off, and perished; the poor girls clung
          close to their cart, and the horse, sometimes wading and sometimes swimming, brought them
          back to land alive, but senseless with terror and distress, and unable for many days to
          give any account of themselves. The bodies of their parents were found the next ebb: that
          of the father a very few paces distant from the spot where he had left them.</p>
        <p>In the afternoon I wandered about the town, and by the quay till it grew dark.</p>
        <p><label><date><w rend="italics">Oct</w>. 12.</date></label> I set out for <placeName><w rend="italics">Settle</w></placeName> by a fine
          turnpike-road, twenty-nine miles, through a rich and beautiful country, diversified with
          frequent villages and churches, very unequal ground; and on the left the river <placeName><w
            rend="italics">Lune</w></placeName> winding in a deep valley, its hanging banks cloathed with fine
          woods, thro' which you catch long reaches of the water, as the road winds about at a
          considerable height above it. In the most picturesque part of the way, I passed the park
          belonging to <persName>the Hon. Mr. <w rend="italics">Clifford</w></persName>, a catholic. The grounds between
          him and the river are indeed charming;* the house is ordinary, and park nothing but a
          rocky fell scattered over with ancient hawthorns. Next I came to <placeName><w rend="italics"
            >Hornby</w></placeName>, a little town on the river <placeName><w rend="italics">Wenning</w></placeName>, over which a

          called the <placeName><w rend="italics">Queen's-road</w></placeName>. To see the view in perfection, you must go
          into a field on the left. Here <placeName><w rend="italics">Ingleborough</w></placeName> behind a variety of
          lesser mountains makes the back-ground of the prospect; on each hand of the middle
          distance, rise two sloping hills; the left cloathed with thick woods the right with
          variegated rock and herbage: between them in the richest of vallies, the <placeName><w rend="italics"
            >Lune</w></placeName> serpentizes for many a mile, and comes forth ample and clear, through a well
          wooded and richly pastured fore-ground. Every feature which constitutes a perfect
          landscape of the extensive fort, is here not only boldly marked, but also in its best
          position.</p>

        <p>the castle, In a lordly situation, attracted me, so I walked up the hill to it: first
          presents itself a large white ordinary sashed gentleman's house, and behind it rises the
          ancient <w rend="italics">keep</w>, built by <persName><hi rend="italics">Edward Stanley</hi>, Lord
            <w rend="italics">Monteagle</w></persName>. He died about <label><date>1529</date></label>, in <persName>King <w rend="italics">Henry</w>
          VIII</persName> time. It is now only a shell, the rasters are laid within it as for flooring. I went
          up a winding stone stair-case in one corner to the leads, and at the angle is a single
          hexagon watch-tower, rising some feet higher, fitted up in the taste of a modern
          summer-house, with sash windows in gilt frames, a stucco cupola, and on the top a vast
          gilt eagle, built by <persName>Mr. <w rend="italics">Charteris</w></persName>, the present possessor. He is the
          second son of the <persName>Earl of <w rend="italics">Wemys</w></persName>, brother to the <persName>Lord <w
            rend="italics">Elcho</w></persName>, and grandson to <persName>Colonel <w rend="italics">Charteris</w></persName>, whose
          name he bears.</p>
        <p>From the leads of the tower there is a fine view of the country round, and much wood near
          the castle. <placeName><w rend="italics">Ingleborough</w></placeName>, which I had seen before distinctly at <placeName><w
            rend="italics">Lancaster</w></placeName> to north-east, was completely wrapped in clouds, all but
          its summit; which might have been easily mistaken for a long black cloud too, fraught with
          an approaching storm. Now our road began gradually to mount towards the Appenine, the
          trees growing less and thinner of leaves, till we came to <placeName><w rend="italics">Ingleton</w></placeName>,
          eighteen miles; it is a pretty village, situated very high, and yet in a valley at the
          foot of that huge monster of nature, <placeName><w rend="italics">Ingleborough</w></placeName>: two torrents
          cross it, with great stones rolled along their beds instead of water; and over them are
          flung two handsome arches. The nipping air, tho' the afternoon was growing very bright,
          now taught us we were in <placeName><w rend="italics">Craven</w></placeName>, the road was all up and down,
          though no where very steep; to the left were mountain tops, to the right a wide valley,
          all inclosed ground, and beyond it high hills again. In approaching <placeName><w rend="italics"
            >Settle</w></placeName>, the crags on the left drew nearer to our way, till we descended <placeName><w

        <p>the <w rend="italics">Ribble</w> over a bridge, I arrived there; it is a small market
          town standing directly under a rocky fell; there are not in it above a dozen good looking
          houses, the rest are old and low, with little wooden porticos in front. My inn pleased me
          much, (though small) for the neatness and civility of the good woman that kept it; so I
          lay there two nights and went,</p>

          six miles from <placeName><w rend="italics">Settle</w></placeName>; but that way was directly over a fell, and as
          the weather was not to be depended on, I went round in a chaise, the only way one could
          get near it in a carriage, which made it full thirteen miles, half of it such a road! but
          I got safe over it, so there's an end, and came to <placeName><w rend="italics">Malham</w></placeName>,
          (pronounced <w rend="italics">Maum</w>) a village in the bosom of the mountains, seated in
          a wild and dreary valley. From thence I was to walk a mile over very rough ground, a
          torrent rattling along on the left hand; on the cliffs above hung a few goats; one of them
          danced and scratched an ear with its hind foot in a place where I would not have stood
          stock-still</p>
        <lg>
          <l>For all beneath the moon.</l>
        </lg>
        <p>As I advanced the crags seemed to close in, but discovered a narrow entrance turning to
          the left between them: I followed my guide a few paces, and the hills opened again into no
          large space; and then all further way is barred by a stream that, at the height of about
          fifty feet, gushes from a hole in the rock, and spreading in large sheets over its broken
          front, dashes from steep to steep, and then rattles away in a torrent down the valley: the
          rock on the left rises perpendicular, with stubbed yew-trees and shrubs starting from its
          sides, to the height of at least 300 feet; but these are not the thing: it is the rock to
          the right, under which you stand to see the fall, that forms the principal horror of the
          place. From its very base it begins to slope forward over you in one black or solid mass
          without any crevice in its surface, and overshadows half the area below its dreadful
          canopy; when I stood at (I</p>

          brow, fell on my head; and in one part of its top, more exposed to the weather, there are
          loose stones that hang in the air, and threaten visibly some idle spectator with instant
          destruction; it is safer to shelter yourself close to its bottom, and trust to the mercy
          of that enormous mass, which nothing but an earthquake can stir. The gloomy uncomfortable
          day well suited the savage aspect of the place, and made it still more formidable: I
          stayed there, not without shuddering, a quarter of an hour, and thought my trouble richly
          paid; for the impression will last for life. At the alehouse where I dined in <hi

          more; <persName><w rend="italics">Smith</w></persName> and <persName><w rend="italics">Bellers</w></persName> had also been there,
          and two prints of <persName><w rend="italics">Gordale</w></persName> have been engraved by them.</p>

            <placeName><w rend="italics">Gordale</w></placeName>, I set out for <placeName><w rend="italics">Skipton</w></placeName>, sixteen
          miles. From several parts of the road, and in many places about <placeName><w rend="italics"
            >Settle</w></placeName>, I saw at once the three famous hills, of this country, <hi rend="italics"
            ><placeName>Ingleborough</placeName>, <placeName>Pennygant</placeName></hi>, and <placeName><w rend="italics">Pendle</w></placeName>; the first is esteemed
          the highest, and their features not to be described, but by the pencil.*</p>
        <p><placeName><w rend="italics">Craven</w></placeName>, after all, is an unpleasing country when seen from</p>
        <p>a height</p>
        <p>* Without the pencil nothing indeed is to be described with precision; and even then that
          pencil ought to be in the very hand of the <roleName>writer</roleName>, ready to supply with outlines every
          thing that his pen cannot express by words. As far as language can describe, <persName>Mr. <w
            rend="italics">Gray</w></persName> has, I think, pushed its powers: for rejecting, as I before
          hinted, every general unmeaning and hyperbolical phrase, he has selected (both in this
          journal, and on other similar occasions) the plainest, simplest, and most direct terms:
          yet notwithstanding his judicious care, in the use of these, I must own I feel them
          defective. They present me, it is true, with a picture of the same species, but not with
          the identical picture: my imagination receives clear and distinct, but not true and exact
          images. It may be asked then, why am I entertained by well written descriptions? I answer,
          because they amuse rather than inform me; and because; after I have seen the places
          described, they serve to recal to my</p>

          trees. Numbers of black cattle are fatted here, both of the Scotch breed, and a larger
          sort of oxen with great horns. There is little cultivated ground, except a few oats.</p>

          very broad street, gently sloping downwards from the castle, which stands at the head of

          meanwhile my mind is flattered by thinking it has acquired some conception of the place,
          and rests contented in an innocent error, which nothing but ocular proof can detect, and
          which, when detected, does not diminish the pleasure I had before received, but augments
          it by superadding the charms of comparison and verification; and herein I would place the
          real and only merit of verbal prose description. To speak of poetical would lead me beyond
          the limits as well as purpose of this note. I cannot, however, help adding that I have
          seen one piece of verbal description, which completely satisfies me, because it is
          throughout assisted by masterly delineation. It is composed by the <persName>Rev. Mr <w

          this tour, our <roleName>author</roleName> visited. This gentleman possessing the conjoined talents of a <roleName>writer</roleName>
          and designer, has employed them in this manuscript to every purpose of picturesque beauty,
          in the description of which a correct eye, a practised pencil, and an eloquent pen could
          assist him. He has, consequently, produced a work unique in its kind at once. But I have
          said it is in manuscript, and, I am afraid, likely to continue so; for would his modesty
          permit him to print it, the great expence of plates would make its publication almost
          impracticable.</p>

        <p>LAST sunday I visited a cavern about five miles from hence, near the road to <placeName><w
            rend="italics">Kirkby-Lonsdale</w></placeName>, called <placeName><w rend="italics">Dunald-mill-hole</w></placeName>, a
          curiosity, I think, inferior to none of the kind in <placeName><w rend="italics">Derbyshire</w></placeName> which
          I have also seen. It is on the middle of a large common, and we are led to it by a brook,
          near as big as the new river, which after turning a corn-mill, just at the entrance of the
          cave, runs in at its mouth by feveral beautiful cascades, continuing its course two miles
          under a large mountain, and at last making its appearance again near <placeName><w rend="italics"
            >Carnforth</w></placeName>, a village in the road to <placeName><w rend="italics">Kendal</w></placeName>. The entrance of
          this subterraneous channel has something most pleasingly horrible in it.—From the mill at
          the top, you descend for about ten yards perpendicular, by means of chinks in the rocks
          and shrubs of trees; the road is then almost parallel to the horizon leading to the right,
          a little winding, till you have some hundreds of yards thick of rocks and minerals above
          you. In this manner we proceeded, sometimes through vaults so capacious, we could not see
          either roof or sides; and sometimes on all four, from its narrowness, still following the
          brook, which entertained us with a sort of harmony well-suiting the place; for the
          different height of its falls were as so many keys of music, which all being conveyed to
          us by the amazing echo, greatly added to the majestic horror which surrounded us. In our
          return we were more particular in our observations. The beautiful lakes (formed by the
          brook in the hollow part of the cavern) realize the fabulous <placeName><w rend="italics">Styx</w></placeName>;
          and the murmuring falls from one rock to another broke the rays of our candles,</p>
        <p><seg type="pagesignature">Q</seg> so</p>

        <p><seg type="pagenumber">228</seg> ADDENDA.</p>
        <p>so as to form the most romantic vibrations and appearances upon the variegated roof. The
          sides too are not less remarkable for fine colouring; the damp, the creeping vegetables,
          and the seams in the marble and limestone parts of the rock make as many tints as are seen
          in the rainbow, and are covered with a perpetual varnish from the just weeping springs
          that trickle from the roof. The curious in grottos, cascades, &amp;c. might here obtain a
          just taste of nature. When we arrived at the mouth and once more hailed all-chearing
          daylight, I could not but admire the uncouth manner in which nature has thrown together
          those huge rocks, which compose the arch over the entrance, but as if conscious of its
          rudeness, she has cloathed it with trees and shrubs of the most various and beautiful
          verdure, which bend downwards, and with their leaves cover all the rugged parts of the
          rock.</p>
            <p>As I never met with an account of this place in any other <roleName>author</roleName>, I therefore think it
          the greater curiosity; but its obscure situation I take to be the reason.</p>
        <p>[Parties, returning from the tour of the lakes to <placeName><w rend="italics">Lancaster</w></placeName>, who
          chuse to see the above natural curiosity, must leave the <placeName><w rend="italics">Lancaster</w></placeName>
          road, to the left, at the guide-post, for <placeName><w rend="italics">Kellet</w></placeName>, about 4 miles from
            <placeName><w rend="italics">Burton</w></placeName>. When in the village (a mile farther on) enquire for the
          road to the mill, which is then near 2 miles distant. Perhaps, when arrived at the cavern,
          if the <roleName>traveller</roleName> should not think it <hi rend="italics">equal to his expectation and
            trouble</hi>, it may yield him some compensation to enjoy one of the best prospects in
          the country, which is then about a mile off, Though hitherto unnoticed, a good deal, I
          think, might be justly said in its praise; but previous description is generally more
          tiresome than welcome.—To find this view, proceed eastward, in the direction of the last
          lane leading to the mill, to the top of the highest rise that you will see on the common
          before you, and you will be at the station. A very little to the east, you will see a good
          road on the moor leading to <placeName><w rend="italics">Lancaster</w></placeName>, distant about 4 miles, and
          the ride will soon entertain with several agreeable objects on the banks of the <w

          this island, tho' caverns are common in all limestone countries. The first (nigh the
          chapel) is a pit sinking from an even surface about forty yards into the ground, and is
          about the same number of yards in diameter. At the bottom is a deep pool of water, from
          whence issues a subterraneous brook, but through so narrow a passage, that in wet weather,
          the cavern fills up, and overflows its brim.—A quarter of a mile above this is another
          pit, of a paralellopiped form, being a chasm between two perpendicular rocks, and though
          upwards of forty yards deep, one may easily leap over it. It seems one of those breaks, or
          faults (as miners call 'em) where the regular strata have been broken, and one part of
          them has sunk below the other; for the bands of rock lie pretty horizontal, and in their
          fissures are found fossils of very curious genera, shells, fish-bones, pipy flints, with
          concretes of shells, stones, moss, and other vegetables, in one mass. Small screw-like
          cylinders, some with holes through, which all effervesce with an acid, and creep in a
          plate filled with vinegar, like those found near <placeName><w rend="italics">Carrickfergus</w></placeName>, in
            <placeName><w rend="italics">Ireland</w></placeName>, by the discharge of their fixt air.</p>

        <p>But a couple of hundred yards above this another cavern opens, much more astonishing than
          the others. The first approach to this presents a perpendicular descent from nearly a
          level surface, beautifully bordered with trees and shrubs, which nature seems to have
          meant as a guard as well as beauty. On one side you may descend, by crawling from one
          broken stratum of rock to another, till you are twenty yards beneath the surface: In the
          descent one may rest between the projecting parts of the rock, or creep many yards
          horizontally between them, where we shall find the rocks and stones encrusted with spar,
          and the cavernous parts filled with petrifactions in the shape of shells, moss, icicles,
          &amp;c. Most of the sparry and roof incrustations, I take to be the fine particles of the
          limestone dissolved by the rain-water, in its descent through the rocks, which sinking
          slowly through the roof of these caverns, the water evaporates, and leaves the fine
          particles of stone to concrete behind; forming hollow conic figures on the roof or if they
          fall on the bottom of the cavern, form those knobs of calcarious fossil, which cut off
          horizontally, are polished into curiously variegated slabs. That the same impregnated
          waters falling on shells, fishbones, &amp;c. should in time displace the calcarious matter
          of which these are naturally formed, and that these stony particles should in time assume
          the same shape and form the shells, bones, snakes, &amp;c. so commonly found in limestone
          countries, I cannot say I am so clear in.—May it not be, that nature has ordained, that
          particles of such and such properties, meeting with a proper nidus in the bowels of the
          earth, and similar to that in which they may assemble on the outside of an animal, may run
          into the same forms, and amuse us with the shape of cockles, limpets, snakes, &amp;c.
          formed in the middle of rocks?</p>
        <p>But to resume our journey down this amazing cavern.—After descending from ledge to ledge
          in a retrograde motion, through arches of prodigious rocks, thrown together by the rude
          but awful hand of nature; at the depth of 70</p>
        <p>yards</p>
        <pb n="248" facs="770.jp2"/>
        <p>ADDENDA <seg type="pagenumber">231</seg></p>
        <p>yards we see a parabolic cascade, rushing from a hole nigh the surface, and falling the
          whole 70 yards, with a roar, which reverberated by the rocks above, confounds and
          astonishes the most intrepid ear! The spray arising from this cascade fills the whole
          cavern, and if the sun happens to shine into it, generates a most vivid and surprising
          rainbow. Another cascade, of not quite so great a fall, issues perpendicularly from a
          projecting rock with equal rapidity as the first, and is certainly a part of the same
          subterraneous brook; they fall together into a narrow pool at the bottom, which measures
          37 yards in depth; and proceeding underground about a mile, break out, and form the large
          brook that runs by <placeName><w rend="italics">Ingleton</w></placeName>, and from thence to the river <placeName><w
            rend="italics">Lune</w></placeName>. In the time of great rains, the subterraneous channel that
          conveys away the water becomes too small, and then the cavern fills to the depth of above
          100 yards, and runs over at the surface.</p>
        <p>To a mind capable of being impressed with the grand and sublime of nature, this is a
          scene that inspires a pleasure chastised by astonishment! Personal safety also insinuates
          itself into the various feelings, where both the eye and ear are so tremendously
          assailed.——To see as much water as would turn several mills, rush from a hole near 70
          yards above the eye, in such a projectile as shews its subterraneous fall to be very
          considerable before it enters the cavern; and to see the fine skirting of wood, with
          various fantastic roots and shrubs, through a spray, enlivened by a perfect rainbow, so
          far above the eye, and yet within the earth, has something more romantic and awful in it
          than any thing of the kind in the three kingdoms!</p>
        <p>Ascending from the dark excavations we found at the bottom of this dreary cavern, we once
          more bless ourselves in broad day-light, and begin to mount the rugged sides of frowning

        <p>of a great circular ditch that incloses the summit, but the extensive and variegated
          prospect seduced me from conjectures and learned surmises. The southern prospect is a
          rugged barrier, that seems to turn the eye towards the fine plains of <placeName><w rend="italics"
            >Lancashire</w></placeName> and <placeName><w rend="italics">Cheshire</w></placeName>; with our glasses we could easily
          distinguish the <w rend="italics">Dee</w> separate the plain from the <placeName><w rend="italics"
            >Welch</w></placeName> mountains;—The fine indentations made by the bays of <placeName><w rend="italics"
            >Liverpool</w></placeName> and <placeName><w rend="italics">Preston</w></placeName>, lead the eye northward to that of <placeName><w
            rend="italics">Lancaster</w></placeName>, which appeared beneath our feet as a map, full of capes
          and inlets. But the sea in front, and the <placeName><w rend="italics">Westmorland</w></placeName> mountains to
          the right, make the sublime of this prospect;—before us the flat fields and woods
          insensibly melt into union with the sea—while the black mountains frown over that element,
          and seem to spurn it from their feet. The <hi rend="italics"><placeName>Hill-bell</placeName>, <placeName>Langdale-pikes</placeName>,
            <placeName>Black-comb</placeName></hi>, &amp;c. are easily distinguished in this chaotic assemblage; while the
          coast of <placeName><w rend="italics">Galloway</w></placeName>, in <placeName><w rend="italics">Scotland</w></placeName>, and the <placeName><hi
            rend="italics">Isle of Man</hi></placeName>, seem as clouds in the back-ground. The east prospect is
          a range of rich sheep moors, of which <placeName><w rend="italics">Ingleborough</w></placeName> appears the surly
          sentry. In our road to <placeName><w rend="italics">Settle</w></placeName> we met with the <placeName><w rend="italics"
            >Ribble</w></placeName>, which tumbles into a deep cavern, and is lost in the bowels of the
          mountains for upwards of three miles, when it issues again into day-light, and with a
          continued roar makes its way to <placeName><w rend="italics">Settle</w></placeName>. From hence I rode through a
          dreadful fog to <w rend="italics">Malm</w> (or <w rend="italics">Malham</w>) about six
          miles to the east, and the road ending in a sheep-track upon the high moors, was in much
          danger of losing my way; but a blast of wind giving me a glimpse of the vale, I got there
          very safe.</p>
        <p>My first excursion was to the <w rend="italics">tarn</w>, (or little lake) skirted on one
          side by a peat bog, and rough limestone rocks, on the other; it abounds in fine trout, but
          has little else remarkable, except being the head of the river <w rend="italics">Air</w>,
          which issuing from it, sinks into the ground very near the lake, and appears again under
          the fine rock which faces the village. In the time of great rains this subterraneous
          passage is too narrow; the brook then makes its way over the top of the rock, falling in a
          most majestic cascade full 60 yards in one sheet. This</p>
        <p>beautiful</p>
        <pb n="250" facs="772.jp2"/>
        <p>ADDENDA. <seg type="pagenumber">233</seg></p>
        <p>beautiful rock is like the age-tinted wall of a prodigious castle; the stone is very
          white, and from the ledges hang various shrubs and vegetables, which with the tints given
          it by the bog water, &amp;c. gives it a variety that I never before saw so pleasing in a
          plain rock. <placeName><w rend="italics">Gordale-scar</w></placeName> was the object: of this excursion. My guide
          brought me first to a fine sheet cascade in a glen about half a mile below the scar, the
          rocks of a beautiful variegation and romantic shrubbery. We then proceeded up the brook,
          the pebbles of which I found incrusted with a soft petrify'd coating, calcarious, slimy,
          and of a light brown colour.—I saw the various strata of the limestone mountains approach
          day-light in extensive and striking bands, running nearly horizontal, and a rent in them
          (from, whence the brook issued) of perpendicular immense rocks:—On turning the corner of
          one of these, and seeing the rent complete—good heavens! what was my astonishment! The <w
            rend="italics">Alps</w>, the <hi rend="italics"><placeName>Pyrenees</placeName>, <placeName>Killarney</placeName>, <placeName>Loch-Lomond</placeName></hi>,
          or any other wonder of the kind I had ever seen, do not afford such a chasm!—— Consider
          yourself in a winding street, with houses above an hundred yards high on each side of
          you;—then figure to yourself a cascade rushing from an upper window, and tumbling over
          carts, waggons, fallen houses, &amp;c. in promiscuous ruin, and perhaps a cockney idea may
          be formed of this tremendous cliff. But if you would conceive it properly, depend upon
          neither pen nor pencil, for 'tis impossible for either to give you an adequate idea of
          it.—I can say no more than that I believe the rocks to be above 100 yards high, that in
          several places they project above 100 yards over their base, and approach the opposite
          rock so near that one would almost imagine it possible to lay a plank from one to the
          other. At the upper end of this rent (which may be about 300 yards horizontally long)
          there gushes a most threatening cascade through a rude arch of monstrous rocks, and
          tumbling through many fantastic masses of its own forming, comes to a rock of entire
          petrifaction, down which it has a variety of picturesque breaks, before it enters a
          channel that conveys it pretty uniformly away.—I take these whimsical shapes to</p>
        <p>be</p>

        <p>be the children of the spray, formed in droughty weather, when the water has time to
          evaporate, and leave the stony matter uninterrupted in its cohesion. These petrifactions
          are very porous; crumbly when dry, and pulpy when wet, and shaped a good deal like crooked
          knotty wood.</p>
        <p>I found here a stratum of white clay, perfectly free from grit, when tried by the
          teeth—it does not effervesce with, an acid, nor dissolve in water. When dry 'tis as white
          as this paper, light, close, soapy, compact, and very hard. It appears to me like the

        <p>SIR,</p>
        <p>ACCORDING to promise, I sit down to give you an account of our summer's excursion.—After
          having made the tour of the lakes, we were induced to proceed from <placeName><w rend="italics"
            >Kendal</w></placeName> by <hi rend="italics"><placeName>Kirkby-Lonsdale</placeName>, <placeName>Ingleton</placeName>, Chapel in the dale,
            <placeName>Horton</placeName></hi>, and <placeName><w rend="italics">Settle</w></placeName>, in order to see the caves and other
          natural curiosities in <placeName><w rend="italics">Craven</w></placeName> in the <w rend="italics"
            >West-riding</w> of <placeName><w rend="italics">Yorkshire</w></placeName>. This second part of our tour was
          more entertaining to most of the party than the first, being peculiarly adapted to our
          taste for natural history, for the great and sublime. While some are pleased with the gay
          and beautiful, others are only to be roused and affected by the grand and terrible. The
          strong and nervous sensations require objects proper for their gratification, no less than
          the most nice and delicate tastes.—If elegant prospects and the refinement of art are
          suited to <w rend="italics">these</w>; the rough, irregular, and stupendous works of
          nature, are no less adapted to the enjoyments of the former. Objects accommodated</p>

        <p>to the hardihood of a genius truly sublime, are only to be met with in this island, among
          the wild and irregular mountains of the north, among the roaring cataracts that roll
          foaming down precipitate from their lofty summits, and the huge and dreary caverns, or
          profound and yawning chasms they contain within their sides:—It is here that nature
          delights, as it were, to perform her magnificent works in secret, silently satisfied with
          self approbation.—As the most amusing part of our tour, was in a country not much
          frequented by the curious and <roleName>speculative traveller</roleName>, and never yet described to the
          public, an account of the objects we met with, may perhaps be not unentertaining: They may
          tend also to excite the curiosity of visiting those unfrequented, yet extraordinary parts
          of our own native country, and to communicate that rational pleasure, which a benevolent
          mind wishes every one of the like sentiments to partake of.</p>
        <p>About six o'clock, one morning in June, we set off from <placeName><w rend="italics">Kendal</w></placeName>, and
          after travelling about a dozen miles, along a good turnpike road over <placeName><w rend="italics"
            >Endmoor</w></placeName>, and <placeName><w rend="italics">Cowbrow</w></placeName>, we arrived at <placeName><w rend="italics"
            >Kirkby-Lonsdale</w></placeName>, soon after eight. About the mid-way we lest the little steep,
          white mountain, <placeName><w rend="italics">Farlton-knot</w></placeName>, on the right about a mile. It is all
          composed of solid limestone, and is two or three hundred yards in depth. Those who have
          seen both, say, that on the west side it is very like the rock at <placeName><w rend="italics"
            >Gibraltar</w></placeName>. There were several good mansion houses by the road side, which, at the
          beginning of this century, were inhabited by a substantial set of <roleName>yeomanry</roleName> and <roleName>country gentlemen</roleName>, the most useful members of a community: They are now however mostly let out to
          farmers; the desire of improving their fortunes in trade, or the pleasure of living in
          towns, have induced the owners to leave them:—Reverses of fortune or new attachments have
          caused many to sell them, after they had been continued many centuries in their families.
            <placeName><w rend="italics">Kirkby-Lonsdale</w></placeName> is a neat, well paved, clean town, ornamented with
          several genteel houses, adjoining to some of which are elegant gardens. The houses</p>

        <p>are covered with blue slate, which has an agreeable effect on the eye of a stranger. A
          small brook runs through the market street, which is useful and commodious to the
          inhabitants; afterwards it turns several mills in its steep descent to the river <placeName><w
            rend="italics">Lune</w></placeName>. The church is a large and decent structure. The roof is covered
          with lead, and supported by three rows of pillars. The steeple is a square tower,
          containing six bells; the music of which we were entertained with at nine o'clock, they
          being played on by the chimes every three hours. Opposite to the church gates is the old
          hall, taken notice of one hundred and fifty years ago by drunken <persName><w rend="italics"
            >Barnaby</w></persName> in his <w rend="italics">Itinerary</w>:—It is still an inn, and no doubt
          keeps up its ancient character.</p>

          simplicity of the vicarage house, which faced us. The pleasant garden adjoining,
          ornamented with a neat octagonal summer house, commanding one of the most delightful
          prospects of nature, must render this sweet retreat an happy abode to the worthy
          .</p>
        <p>We walked through the church yard, which is large and spacious, along the margin of an
          high and steep bank, to a</p>
        <p>neat</p>

        <p>neat white mansion house full in view, somewhat above half a mile distant, called <w
            rend="italics">Underlay</w>.—The prospect, was of the most amusing kind. At the foot of
          the steep bank on which we walked, being about forty or fifty yards perpendicular, glided
          the large, pellucid river <placeName><w rend="italics">Lune</w></placeName>, amongst the rocks and pebbles, which
          amused the ear, whilst the eye was entertaining itself with a vast variety of agreeable
          objects. A transparent sheet of still water about half a mile in length lay stretched out
          before us: At the high end of it was a grotesque range of impending rocks of red stone,
          about thirty yards in perpendicular height, which had an excellent effect in the scene,
          both by their colour and situation. We were told that in winter this precipice was in some
          parts so glazed over with ice, from the trickling water down the surface, as to make it
          appear like a sheet of alabaster. From other parts of the impending rocks, hung great and
          enormous icicles, which made it appear like an huge organ.</p>
        <p>After the eye had traversed over a rich and fertile vale, variegated with woods and
          country houses, the prospect was terminated with a chain of lofty mountains, which run in
          a direction from south to north, parallel to the course of the river. The nearest were not
          above two or three miles off, and looked like the bold and surly centries of a legion,
          that seemed stationed beyond them. On our return we were amused with prospects of a
          different nature. The church and town before us enlivened the scene: Some mill-wheels
          between them and the river, added an agreeable variety with their motion. The vale beneath
          seemed to dilate and expand itself; the few parts of it, which were visible afforded
          sufficient ground to the imagination to conceive an assemblage of the most entertaining
          objects. <placeName><w rend="italics">Ingleborough</w></placeName>, whose head was wrapt in a cloud, stood the
          farthest to the south in the rank of mountains which faced us.</p>
        <p>After breakfast, we walked by the side of the river to the bridge. The channel is deep,
          the stream rapid among rocks,</p>
        <p>the</p>
        <pb n="256" facs="778.jp2"/>
        <p>ADDENDA. <seg type="pagenumber">239</seg></p>
        <p>the banks on each side covered with trees of various foliage, which serve both as a
          defence and ornament. The bridge is the most lofty, strong, ancient, and striking to the
          eye of a stranger, of any I have yet seen. It is built of freestone, has three arches, two
          large and one smaller; the height from the surface of the water to the top of the centre
          arch, except in a flood, is about twelve yards. The arches are of the ribbed sort, which
          make the appearance the more grotesque. There is no memorial of its foundation; a negative
          argument of its vast antiquity. We were indeed amused with one anecdote of its founder,
          which seemed to be a remnant of the ancient mythology of the north, and one instance,
          among many, of easily accounting for any thing that is marvellous. The country people have
          a tradition, that it was built by <persName>the devil</persName> one night in windy weather; he had but one
          apron full of stones for the purpose, and unfortunately his apron-string breaking as he
          flew with them, over <placeName><w rend="italics">Casterton-fell</w></placeName>, he lost many of them out, or
          the bridge would have been much higher.</p>
        <p>From the top of the bridge the prospect down the river is delightful; the sides of the
          deep channel covered with trees, are nearly parallel for half a mile, and the water one
          continued surface, save here and there where a pointed rock lifts up its head above the
          stream. We walked down by the side of the river about a mile, and as we proceeded were
          continually presented with new prospects, while the soft murmurs of the river afforded a
          variety of different notes. The vale of <placeName><w rend="italics">Lonsdale</w></placeName> dilating by
          degrees, presented us in succession with the different seats and villages that adorn it:
            <placeName><w rend="italics">Whittington</w></placeName>, and <placeName><w rend="italics">Arkholm</w></placeName>, to the west; <hi
            rend="italics"><placeName>Tunstal</placeName>, <placeName>Melling</placeName>, <placeName>Hornby</placeName></hi> and its castle, to the south; and <placeName><w
            rend="italics">Leck</w></placeName> to the east. The brown and blue mountains of <placeName><w rend="italics"
            >Burnmore</w></placeName>, and <placeName><w rend="italics">Lyth-fell</w></placeName>, terminated the view, which we could
          have wished had extended still farther to the south. While we were selecting various
          objects for our amusement, we suddenly and insensibly arrived at <placeName><w rend="italics"
            >Overborough</w></placeName>, the seat of <persName><hi rend="italics">Thomas Fenwick</hi></persName> Esq; a modern
          house, and one of the largest and most elegant in the county</p>

        <p>of <placeName><w rend="italics">Lancaster</w></placeName>, being situated on a rising ground, though near the
          river <w rend="italics">Lune</w>, its different fronts command all the delightful
          prospects which the vale affords. During our excursion through the gardens and pleasure
          grounds adjoining, we were presented with views of a different sort to any we had hitherto
          enjoyed. Sometimes we were embowered with woods and lofty trees—nothing of the adjacent
          country to be seen, save here and there the blue peak of <placeName><w rend="italics"
            >Ingleborough</w></placeName> or some neighbouring mountain, till we croffed a broad vista, which
          suddenly exhibited a new and unexpected scene of the winding vale beneath. A stranger in
          going from the hall to the gardens must be struck with a surprise bordering on terror, on
          viewing the profound and gloomy glen by the side of his way. The trees, which guard this
          steep bank prevent the eye from seeing the river <placeName><w rend="italics">Leck</w></placeName>, which flows
          through a chasm amongst rocks at the bottom: Imagination is left to conceive the cause of
          the deep and solemn murmurs beneath.</p>
        <p>Our ideas of the beauties of art and nature were mellowed and refined by those of
          venerable antiquity. We were now on classic ground; <placeName><w rend="italics">Overborough</w></placeName>

          the bridge full in view most of the way: Its antiquity and greatness made its presence
          venerable and respected. About a furlong before we arrived at the bridge the town of <placeName><w
            rend="italics">Kirkby-Lonsdale</w></placeName> appeared in a point of view peculiarly pleasing. The
          high walls of a gentleman's garden, which were between us and the town, made it look like
          a fenced city in miniature; the tower steeple of the church rising proudly eminent above
          the blue stated houses, with which it was on every side surrounded.</p>
        <p>† We mounted our horses at the bridge about eleven o'clock, having ordered them down
          thither in order to save half an hour in going up the town for them. We travelled near the

          and amidst a variety of entertaining prospects. The number of small carts laden with
          coals, and each dragged by one forry horse, that we met, was surprising to a stranger.
          Many of the smaller farmers, betwixt <placeName><w rend="italics">Kirkby-Lonsdale</w></placeName> and <placeName><w
            rend="italics">Kendal</w></placeName>, earn their bread with carrying coals, during most part of the

            >Kendal</w></placeName>, and the neighbouring places, for fewel, and burning lime in order to manure
          their land. These beds of coal, we were informed, are six or seven feet in thickness. A
          fire-engine was erecting at <placeName><w rend="italics">Black-Burton</w></placeName>, more commodiously to work
          their best collieries. A survey was lately subscribed for to be made, in order to have a
          canal from these pits to <placeName><w rend="italics">Lancaster</w></placeName>, where coals might be exported;
          as also to <placeName><w rend="italics">Kendal</w></placeName> and <placeName><w rend="italics">Settle</w></placeName>, which are towns
          much in want of fewel.</p>
        <p>After we had got about six miles from <placeName><w rend="italics">Kirkby-Lonsdale</w></placeName>, to a public
          house called <placeName><w rend="italics">Thornton-church-stile</w></placeName>, we stopped to procure a guide,
          candles, lanthorn, tinder-box, &amp;c. for the purpose of seeing <placeName><w rend="italics"
            >Yordas-cave</w></placeName>, in the vale of <placeName><w rend="italics">Kingsdale</w></placeName>, about four miles off.
          By the advice of a friend, we took also with us a basket of provisions, which we found
          afterwards were of real service. When we had gone about a mile, we were entertained with a
          fine cascade, called <placeName><w rend="italics">Thornton-force</w></placeName>, near some slate quarries, made
          by the river issuing out of <placeName><w rend="italics">Kingsdale</w></placeName>. This cataract had some
          features different to any we had yet seen among the lakes: but which greatly conduced to
          render it peculiarly engaging. Part of the river tumbled with impetuosity from the top of
          a stratum of huge rocks, perpendicularly about 20 yards: Another part of it, in search of
          a nearer and less violent course, had discovered a subterranean passage, and gushed out of
          the side of the precipice; when they immediately again united their streams in a large,
          round, deep, and black bason at the bottom. From the margin of this pool the view may be
          taken to the greatest</p>

        <p>advantage: The high rock on the south and opposite side, about half a dozen yards higher
          than the cascade, and mantled with shrubs and ivy, leaves nothing on that hand for the
          imagination to supply. If the archetype was not in being, it might be thought the
          subterranean stream was added to the picture, by the ingenuity of the artist, in order to
          give a finishing stroke to the beauty of the scene. This little river is worthy the
          company of the <roleName>curious tourist</roleName> for about a mile along its course through a deep grotesque
          glen, fortified on each side by steep or impending high rocks. About a mile higher we came
          to the head of the river, which issues from one fountain called <placeName><w rend="italics"
            >Keld's-head</w></placeName>, * to all appearance more copious than <placeName><hi rend="italics">St.
            Winifred's well</hi></placeName>, in <placeName><w rend="italics">Flintshire</w></placeName>; though there is a broken,
          serpentine, irregular channel, extending to the top of the vale, down which a large stream
          is poured from the mountains in rainy weather. We now found ourselves in the midst of a
          small valley about three miles long, and somewhat more than half a mile broad, the most
          extraordinary of any we had yet seen: It was surrounded on all sides by high mountains,
          some of them the loftiest of any in <placeName><w rend="italics">England</w></placeName>,—<placeName><w rend="italics"
            >Whernside</w></placeName> to the south-east, and <placeName><w rend="italics">Gragareth</w></placeName> to the north.
          There was no descent from this vale, except the deep chasm where we saw the cascade. It
          seemed opened in some distant age, either by the gradual effect of the washing of the
          river, or some violent and extraordinary flood, bursting open the rugged barrier that pent
          it up: The vale above has all the appearance of having been once a lake, from the flatness
          of its surface, and its rich foil, like a sediment subsided on the bottom of a stagnant
          water. We were informed that the subterranean cascade beneath, just now mentioned, has but
          lately made its appearance and is every day more and more enlarging. We were quite
          secluded from the world, not an habitation for man in view, but a <roleName>lonely shepherd</roleName>'s
          house,</p>

            >Breadagarth</w></placeName>: It is on the north side of an high mountain, seldom visited by man,
          and never by the sun for near half a year. The <roleName>shepherd</roleName>, its solitary inhabitant, with
          longing eyes looks for returning verdure, when the sun begins to throw his benign rays on
          the solitary abode. No monk or anchoret could desire a more retired situation for his
          cell, to moralize on the vanity of the world, or disappointed lover to bewail the
          inconstancy of his nymph. The soil seemed the deepest and richest in some parts of this
          vale of any we had ever observed, and no doubt is capable of great improvement. We could
          not but lament that instead of peopling the wilds and desarts of <placeName><hi rend="italics">North
            America</hi></placeName>, our fellow subjects had not peopled the fertile wastes of the north of <placeName><w
            rend="italics">England</w></placeName>. We have since indeed been informed that a plan is in
          agitation for having it inclosed, when no doubt but it will support some scores of
          additional families. While we were musing on the many bad effects of peopling distant
          countries and neglecting our own, we arrived at the object of this excursion, <placeName><w
            rend="italics">Yordas-cave</w></placeName>: It is almost at the top of the vale, on the north west
          side of it, under the high mountain <placeName><w rend="italics">Gragareth</w></placeName>. We discovered it by
          some sheep-folds at the mouth of a rugged gill or glen, in which we safely pent up our
          horses. In rainy seasons we were told a copious stream is poured down this gill, and a
          cascade falls over the very entrance into the cave, so as to prevent any farther approach.
          We however were favoured by the weather, and met with no obstacle of that nature to stop
          our ingress, but boldly entered a large aperture to the left into the side of the
          mountain, like the great door of some cathedral. Having never been in a cave before, a
          thousand ideas, which had been for many years dormant, were excited in my imagination on
          my entrance into this gloomy cavern. Several passages out of <hi rend="italics"><persName>Ovid</persName>'s
            Metamorphosis, <persName>Virgil</persName></hi>, and other classics crowded into my mind together. At one
          time I thought it like the den where <persName><w rend="italics">Cadmus</w></persName> met the-huge

          <l>Within this vale there rose a shady wood</l>
          <l>Of aged trees; in its dark bosom stood</l>
          <l>A bushy thicket, pathless and unworn,</l>
          <l>O'errun with brambles, and perplex'd with thorn:</l>
          <l>Amidst the brake a hollow den was found,</l>

        <p>The height of this cave was some where between a dozen and twenty yards, the breadth
          about the same dimension with the height, and the length at least fifty or sixty yards.
          Some of the party who had seen both, thought it much more stupendous and magnificent, than

        <p>Having passed a small brook which one of the party called the <placeName><w rend="italics"
            >Stygian</w> lake</placeName>, we came to the western side of the cave. It is a solid perpendicular
          rock of black marble, embellished with many rude sketches, and names of persons now long
          forgotten, the dates of some being above two hundred years old. After we had proceeded
          thirty or forty yards northward, past some huge rocks that had sometime fallen from the
          roof or side, and arrived at a colonade of rude mossy pillars standing obliquely on their
          bases; the road divided itself into two parts, but not like that of <persName><w rend="italics"

        <p>No, they both had a divine tendency: On the right was the bishop's throne, and on the
          left the chapter-house, so called from their resemblance to these appendages of a
          cathedral. Here we could not but lament the devastation made in the ornaments of these
          sacred places; some Goths not long since, having defaced both throne and chapter-house of
          their pendent petrified works, which had been some ages in forming. The little cascades
          which fell in various places from the roof</p>
        <p>and</p>

        <p>and sides, with different trilling notes, served to entertain the ear with their watery
          music; while the eye was busy in amusing itfelf with the curious reflections which were
          made by our lights from the streams and petrifactions which appeared all around us. We
          were told by our guide, what a great effect the discharge of a gun or pistol would have
          upon our ears: But not being desirous to carry our experimental philosophy so far as to
          endanger or to give pain to the organs of hearing, we were not disappointed in having no
          apparatus for the purpose. We followed a winding passage amongst high and grotesque
          pillars, being led by the noise of a falling stream, till we arrived at the chapter house.
          From the dome of this natural edifice fell a fine and clear cascade into a bason of
          transparent water, which served in a peculiar manner to embellish the works of nature, in
          a stile superior to any thing we can have in those of art. We were shewn a low and narrow
          passage on one of the shelves of the rock near the chapter-house, which we were informed
          led to a wider path, extending itself into the heart of the mountain; but our curiosity
          was satisfied without crawling among the rocks besmeared with slime and mud.</p>
        <p>If we had not been cautioned to beware of coming out too suddenly, lest the quick
          transition from the dreary gloom of the cavern into the glare of sunshine should injure
          the sense of feeing, the curiosity for exploring every part in our return, now when our
          eyes were more opened, was sufficient to retard our steps and prevent a too hasty egress.
          While we were regaling ourselves with the provisions we had brought, we enquired of our
          guide, if he could furnish us with any curious ancedotes relative to this cave. After
          informing us that it had been alternately the habitation of giants and fairies, as the
          different mythology prevailed in the country; he mentioned two circumstances we paid some
          attention to. About fifty or sixty years ago, a madman escaped from his friends at or near
            <placeName><w rend="italics">Ingleton</w></placeName>, and lived here a week, in the winter season, having had
          the precaution to take off a cheese and</p>
        <p><seg type="pagesignature">R 4</seg> some</p>
        <pb n="265" facs="787.jp2"/>
        <p><seg type="pagenumber">248</seg> ADDENDA.</p>
        <p>some other provisions to his subterranean hermitage. As there was snow on the ground, he
          had the cunning of <persName><w rend="italics">Cacus</w></persName>, (see <hi rend="italics">Virgil's
            AEneid</hi>, L. 8. 1. 209.) to pull the heels off his shoes, and set them on inverted at
          the toes, to prevent being traced: An instance, among many others, of a madman's reasoning
          justly on some detached part of an absurd plan or hypothesis. Since that time, he told us
          a poor woman big with child, travelling alone up this inhospitable vale to that of <placeName><w
            rend="italics">Dent</w></placeName>, was taken in labour, and found dead in this cave.</p>
        <p>We next proceeded to examine the pits and chasms apparently caused by the water after it
          has run through the cave: We ascended the hill a little higher to view the gill above the
          cave: A stream of water flowed down it, which entering an aperture in the rock, we could
          see descend from steep to steep a considerable way. We made no doubt but it was the same
          stream which afterwards falls down through the roof of the chapter-house. Here was also a
          quarry of black marble, of which elegant monuments, chimneys, slabs, and other pieces of
          furniture are made by a <persName>Mr. <w rend="italics">Tomlinson</w></persName>, at <placeName><hi rend="italics">Burton
            in Lonsdale</hi></placeName>; when polished this marble appears to be made up of entrochi, and
          various parts of testaceous and piscosous reliques.</p>
        <p>We were persuaded to climb up to the top of the base of <placeName><w rend="italics">Gragareth</w></placeName>,
          the mountain in whose side <placeName><w rend="italics">Yordas</w></placeName> is situated, in order so see <placeName><w
            rend="italics">Gingling-cave</w></placeName>. It is on the edge of the flat base of the mountain, on
          a green plain by the side of a brook looking down into the vale, <placeName><w rend="italics"
            >Ingleborough</w></placeName> appearing a little to the left or north-east of <placeName><w rend="italics"
            >Breada-garth</w></placeName>, which was almost opposite. This natural curiosity is a round
          aperture; narrow at the top, but most probably dilating in its dimensions to a profound
          extent. The stones we threw in made an hollow gingling noise for a considerable time. At
          intervals we could hear nothing of their descent, then again we heard them resound in
          deeper keys, till they were either immersed in some deep pool or were arrived at too great
          a distance to be heard; for there seemed a variety of different passages for their
          descent, some being much sooner intercepted</p>

        <p>in their career than others. Two dogs that were with us, and a small horse brought up by
          one of the party, seemed violently agitated and under fearful trepidations, under horrors
          resembling those, we are told the animal creation are seized with, preceeding or during an
          earthquake. Though our reason convinced us of the impossibility of the ground falling in
          beneath us, we could not but feel many apprehensions accompanied with sensations hitherto
          unknown. We could not learn that any swain had ever been adventrous enough to be let down
          in ropes into this vast hiatus, to explore those unseen regions, either from a principle
          of curioisity, or to search for hidden mines. We were informed of some other openings into
          this mountain of a like kind with <placeName><w rend="italics">Gingling-cave</w></placeName>, but being at a
          distance and of an inferior nature, we returned to <placeName><w rend="italics">Yordas</w></placeName> for our
          horses, which we had pent up in the sheep-folds; and proceeding down the vale, we crossed
          over it at the the bottom to <placeName><w rend="italics">Twisleton</w></placeName>, and soon arrived at <placeName><w
            rend="italics">Ingleton</w></placeName>.</p>
        <p>* After we had regaled and rested ourselves comfortably at the <placeName><w rend="italics"
            >Bay-horse</w></placeName>, we took an evening walk about a mile above the town, to the state
          quarries by the side of <placeName>the river <w rend="italics">Wease</w></placeName>, or <placeName><w rend="italics"

          had objects both of art and nature to amuse ourselves with: On one hand was a precipice
          ten or twelve yards perpendicular, made by the labour of man, being a quarry of fine large
          blue slate, affording an useful and ornamental cover for the houses in the adjoining parts
          of <hi rend="italics"><placeName>Yorkshire</placeName>, <placeName>Lancashire</placeName></hi>, and <placeName><w rend="italics">Westmorland</w></placeName>:

          he may go either below <placeName><w rend="italics">Breada-garth</w></placeName> to <placeName><w rend="italics"

          of stones, called an hurder, on the base of <placeName><w rend="italics">Whernside</w></placeName>, and then to
          turn round the west corner of the mountain: Afterwards he must turn his course easterly
          along the base of the mountain till he comes to some lanes, any of which will lead him by
          some houses down to the chapel in the middle of the vale between <placeName><w rend="italics"

        <p>hand was the river rolling down from rock to rock in a narrow deep chasm, where there was
          no room for human foot to tread between the stream and the rugged, high, steep rocks on
          each side. Several pieces of the slate were bespangled with yellow marcasites of a cubic
          form, and different sizes, others were gilded over with the various foliages of ferns,
          pines, oaks, and other vegetables. This bed of slate runs nearly from south to north by
          this place and the quarry near <placeName><w rend="italics">Thornton-force</w></placeName>. Its length maybe
          traced two or three miles, though but 200 or 300 yards in breadth, and indeed of good
          state but a few yards broad: The plain of the stratum is nearly perpendicular to the
          horizon, and may afford mattee of speculation to the natural philosopher, as to its cause,
          whether from some melted and liquid matter, being forced, up there at the deluge, or some
          subsequent volcano; as it is limestone rock on both the east and west side of it, and
          apparently severed asunder by the weight of the western stratum separating from the above
          by its inclination to the vale beneath. We crossed the river by means of the broken
          fragments of rocks, which afforded us their rugged backs above the surface of the water to
          tread on. Here we met with a fine field for our entertainment as botanists. There was the
          lady's slipper, the fly orchis, rarely to be met with elsewhere, and many other scarce and
          curious plants. We crossed over to take a second view of <placeName><w rend="italics"
            >Thornton-force</w></placeName>, on the south side of the <placeName><w rend="italics">Kingsdale</w> river</placeName>, and
          followed its murmuring stream down a deep glen, fortified with high precipices on each

        <p><placeName><w rend="italics">Ingleton</w></placeName> is a pretty village, pleasantly situated on a natural

            >Lancaster</w></placeName>. The murmurs of the streams below sooth the ear, while the eye is
          selecting a variety of objects for its entertainment. On the back-ground are the lofty
          mountains of <hi rend="italics"><placeName>Gragareth</placeName>, <placeName>Whernside</placeName>,</hi> and <placeName><w rend="italics"
            >Ingleborough</w></placeName>, the summits of which, when they are not enveloped in the clouds, can

          when he puts on his night-cap, there are often strong gusts, called helm winds, blowing
          from thence to that part of the country which adjoins to its base. The like observation is

          the coast of <placeName><w rend="italics">Africa</w></placeName>. They are called helm winds from their blowing
          from the cloud or helmet that covers the head of the mountain. Amongst other

        <p>appearance very striking to the naturalist: There were high precipices of limestone rock
          on each side; and the intermediate vale to a lively imagination would seem once to have
          been of the same height, but sunk down by the breaking of pillars, which had supported the

          hand side of the road, only a few yards distant from it. It gushes out of several
          fountains at once, all within twenty or thirty yards of each other; having run about two
          miles underground, though making its appearance in two or three places, within that
          distance. When there are floods, it runs also above ground, though not in all places,
          except the rains are extraordinary great. This is the subterranean river mentioned by <persName>Dr.

            >Ingleton</w></placeName>, we turned off the turnpike road to some houses near the chapel, where we
          left our horses. At first we imagined we had here met with an exception to the maxim of

          were blessed with others as valuable by way of compensation. They abound with excellent
          hay grounds and pastures, and were rich in large flocks and herds of cattle, which enabled
          them to purchase every conveniency of life. Having little intercourse with the luxurious,
          vicious, and designing part of mankind, they were temperate, substantial, sincere, and
          hospitable.</p>

        <p>The first curiosity we were conducted to was <placeName><w rend="italics">Hurtlepot</w></placeName>, about
          eighty yards above the chapel.* It is a round deep hole, between thirty and forty yards
          diameter, surrounded with rocks almost on all sides, between thirty and forty feet
          perpendicular above a deep black water, in a subterranean cavity at its bottom. All round
          the top of this horrid place are trees, which grow secure from the axe; their branches
          almost meet in the center, and spread a gloom over a chasm, dreadful enough of itself
          without being heightened with any additional appendages: It was indeed one of the most
          dismal prospects we had yet been presented with. Almost every sense was affected in such
          an uncommon manner, as to excite ideas of a nature truly horribly sublime. When ever we
          threw in a pebble or spoke a word, our ears were assailed with a dismal hollow sound; our
          nostrils were affected with an uncommon complication of strong smells, from the ramps and
          other weeds that grew plentifully about its sides, and the rank vapours that exhaled from
          the black abyss beneath. The descent of <persName><w rend="italics">AEneas</w></persName> into the infernal
          regions came again fresh into my imagination, and the following passage out of Virgil
          obtruded itself on my memory.</p>

          the bottom with its ruins. A large cascade is distinctly heard through this rubbish. If a
          descent was opened, no doubt but a subterranean passage would be discovered leading either
          to the caves above the chapel, or, more probably to <placeName><w rend="italics">Dank-cave</w></placeName>, on

        <p>After viewing for some time with horror and astonishment its dreadful aspect from the
          top, we were emboldened to descend by a steep and slippery passage to the margin of this
          Avernian lake. What its depth is we could not learn; but from the length of time the
          sinking stones we threw in continued to send up bubbles from the black abyss, we concluded
          it to be very profound. How far it extended under the huge pendent rocks we could get no
          information, a subterranean embarkation having never yet been fitted out for discoveries.
          In great floods we were told this pot runs over; some traces of it then remained on the
          grass. While we stood at the bottom, the awful silence was broken every three or four
          seconds, by drops of water falling into the lake from the rocks above, in different solemn
          keys. The sun shining on the surface of the water, illuminated the bottom of the
          super-incumbent rocks, only a few feet above; which, being viewed by reflection in the
          lake, caused a curious deception, scarce any where to be met with: They appeared at the
          like distance below its surface in form of a rugged bottom. But alas! how fatal would be
          the consequence, if any adventurer should attempt to wade across the abyss on this shadow
          of a foundation. While we were standing on the margin of this sub-</p>

        <p>terranean lake we were suddenly astonished with a most uncommon noise on the surface of
          the water under the pendent rocks. It is called by the country people <placeName><w rend="italics"
            >Hurtlepot-boggart</w></placeName>, and sometimes the <w rend="italics">Fairy-churn</w>, as a churn
          it resembles. It is no doubt frightful to them, and would have been so to us, if we had
          not been apprized of the cause. We found it was effected by the glutting of the surface of
          the water against the bottom of some rocks or passages worn into them to a considerable
          distance, when it was descending after rain, as then happened to be the case. This deep is
          not without its inhabitants; large black trouts are frequently caught in it by the
          neighbouring people. Botanists find here some rare and curious plants.</p>
            <p>On our return from the margin of this Avernian lake, we found the observation of the <roleName>poet</roleName>

        <p>When we arrived in the superior regions, we pursued our journey about a hundred and fifty
          yards farther up a very narrow grotesque glen, over a natural bridge of limestone above
          ten yards thick, having the subterranean river<placeName><w rend="italics">Wease</w></placeName>, or <placeName><w
            rend="italics">Greta</w></placeName> underneath. When we got to the head of this gill, we were stopt
          by a deep chasm called <placeName><w rend="italics">Ginglepot</w></placeName>, at the bottom of a precipice: It
          is of an oblong and narrow form; an enterprizing person with a steady head and active
          heels, regardless of the fatal consequences from a false step, might leap over it. It is
          filled with smooth pebbles at the bottom,</p>
        <p>except</p>
        <pb n="273" facs="795.jp2"/>
        <p><seg type="pagenumber">256</seg> ADDENDA.</p>
        <p>except at the south corner, where there is deep water, which, in floods swells up to the
          top, and issues out in a vast torrent. The length of this chasm is about ten yards, and
          the perpendicular depth, at the north corner, about twenty yards. In our way from <placeName><w
            rend="italics">Hurtlepot</w></placeName>, we could not help remarking the ruins of two small
          artificial mounts of earth, which we were told formerly served as butts, when the
          inhabitants exercifed themselves in the ancient military accomplishment of archery. The
          naturalist must also be entertained with the successful efforts that had been made by the
          roots of some old ashes, to get across the dry and broad bed of rocks to a rich bed of
          sandy soil, in order to support their aged parents, for ever doomed to dwell on the steep
          side of a barren and rugged cliff.</p>
        <p>Returning back a little way from <placeName><w rend="italics">Ginglepot</w></placeName> in order to find a
          passage out of this dreary glen, we proceeded about a hundred and twenty yards higher when
          we came to <placeName><w rend="italics">Weathercoate-cave</w></placeName> or <w rend="italics">cove</w>, * the
          most surprising natural curiosity of the kind in the island of <placeName><hi rend="italics">Great
            Britain</hi></placeName>. It is a stupendous subterranean cataract in a huge cave, the top of which
          is on the same level with the adjoining lands. On our approach to its brink, our ears and
          eyes were equally astonished with the sublime and terrible. The margin was surrounded with
          trees and shrubs, the foliage of which was of various shapes and colours, which had an
          excellent effect, both in guarding and ornamenting the steep and rugged precipices on
          every side. Where the eye could penetrate through the leaves and branches, there was room
          for the imagination to conceive this cavern more dreadful and horrible, if possible, than
          it was in</p>
        <p>reality.</p>
        <p>* The word <w rend="italics">cave</w> is pronounced by the country people <w
            rend="italics">cove</w>, or <w rend="italics">coave</w>. This hint may be of service to
          a stranger in his enquiries. This cave is not above 100 yards from the turnpike road irom
            <placeName><w rend="italics">Lancaster</w></placeName> to <placeName><w rend="italics">Richmond</w></placeName>: It is on the left
          hand side of the twenty second mile stone from <placeName><w rend="italics">Lancaster</w></placeName>, from
          whence the cascade may be distinctly heard. The delicate and timid may neither be afraid
          of their persons or cloaths, if they have no mind to descend. They may stand sate on the
          margin of either <hi rend="italics"><placeName>Hurtlepot</placeName>, <placeName>Ginglepot</placeName></hi>, or <placeName><w rend="italics"
            >Weathercoate-cave</w></placeName>. They will there see enough to astonish them, and imagination
          will supply the rest,</p>

        <p>reality. This cave is of a lozenge form, and divided into two by a rugged and grotesque
          arch of limestone rock: The whole length from south to north is about sixty yards, and the
          breadth about half its length. At the south end is the entrance down into the little cave;
          on the right of which is a subterranean passage under the rocks, and a petrifying well: A
          stranger cannot but take notice of a natural seat and table in a corner of this grotesque
          room, well suited for a <roleName>poet</roleName> or <roleName>philosopher</roleName>: Here he may be secluded from the bustle of
          the world, though not from noise; the uniform roaring however of the cascade will exclude
          from the ear every other sound, and his retirement will conceal him from every object that
          might divert the eye. Having descended with caution from rock to rock, we passed under the
          arch and came into the great cave, where we stood sometime in silent astonishment to view
          this amazing cascade. The perpendicular height of the north corner of this cave, was found
          by an exact admeasurement to be thirty six yards: Near eleven yards from the top issues a
          torrent out of an hole in the rock, about the dimensions of a large door in a church,
          conveying usually as much water as the new river at <placeName><w rend="italics">London</w></placeName>. It
          rushes forwards with a curvature which shews, that it has had a steep descent before it
          appears in open day; and tumbles precipitate twenty five yards perpendicular down on the
          rocks at the bottom, with a noise that amazes the most intrepid ear. The water sinks as it
          falls amongst the rocks and pebbles, running by a subterranean passage about a mile, where
          it appears again by the side of the turnpike road, visiting in its way the other caverns
          of <placeName><w rend="italics">Ginglepot</w></placeName> and <placeName><w rend="italics">Hurtlepot</w></placeName>. The cave is filled
          with the spray that arises from the water dashing against the bottom, and the sun
          happening to shine very bright, we had a small vivid rainbow within a few yards of us, for
          colour, size, and situation, perhaps no where else to be equalled. An huge rock that had
          sometime been rolled down by the impetuosity of the stream, and was suspended between us
          and the top of the cascade, like the coffin of <persName><w rend="italics">Mahomet</w></persName> at <placeName><w
            rend="italics">Medina</w></placeName>, had an excellent effect in the scene. Though the stream</p>

        <p>had polished the surfaces of the pebbles on which it fell at the bottom by rolling them
          against each other; yet its whole force was not able to drive from its native place the
          long black moss that firmly adhered to the large immoveable rocks. We were tempted to
          descend into a dark chamber at the very bottom of the cave, covered over with a ceiling of
          rock above thirty yards thick, and from thence behind the cascade, at the expence of
          having our cloaths a little wet and dirtied, when the noise became tremendous, and the
          idea for personal safety awful and alarming, as the rocks on which we stood and every one
          about us seemed to shake with the vast concussion. We were informed that in a great
          drought the divergency of the stream is so small, that we might with safety go quite round
          the cascade. At the bottom we were shewn a crevice where we might descend to the
          subterranean channel, which would lead us to <placeName><w rend="italics">Ginglepot</w></placeName>, and perhaps
          much further; we were also shewn above, a shallow passage between the strata of rocks,
          along which we might crawl to the orifice out of which the cascade issued, where it was
          high enough to walk erect, and where we might have the honour of making the first
          expedition for discoveries; no creature having yet proceeded in that passage out of sight
          of day-light: But as we were apprehensive the pleasure would not be compensated by the
          dangers and difficulties to be encountered in our progress, we did not attempt to explore
          these new regions. * After a little rain another cascade similar to the former</p>
        <p>falls</p>
            <p>* The <roleName>writer</roleName> of this <w rend="italics">Tour</w>, in company with the owner of the cave
          and some others, has since been in the passage out of which the cascade issues; but not
          able to tell how far it extends, as it was high and wide enough to admit passengers much
          farther than they were. The owner of the cave and others have been in the passage beneath,
          half way to <placeName><w rend="italics">Ginglepot</w></placeName>: They have no doubt but it leads thither, they
          did not get so far, owing to the water deepening, more than the height lessening. Another
          subterranean river, that from <placeName><w rend="italics">Gatekirk</w></placeName> above meets this cascade
          directly underneath it, along which there is a passage and which the above party in some
          measure through mistake explored, by missing their way in their return, by getting far
          beyond the cascade before they were convinced of their error, by the noise of the cascade
          gradually decreasing.</p>
        <pb n="276" facs="798.jp2"/>
        <p>ADDENDA. <seg type="pagenumber">259</seg></p>
        <p>falls nearly from the same height on the west side of the cave, appearing and
          disappearing with great variety amongst the rocks, as if it fell down the chimney of a
          ruinous building, where several holes were made into it in the gable-end. If the rains
          still encrease, a large stream sets in out of the room by the side of the little cave; and
          in great floods a vast river falls into the great cave down the precipice on the eastern
          side. Nothing can be more grotesque and terrible than to view this cave when about half
          full of water. A variety of cascades issue from crannies in every quarter; some as small
          as a tap in an hogshead and others as copious as rivers, all pouring with impetuosity into
          this deep and rugged bason. With their united streams they are sometimes able to fill the
          whole capacity of the cavern and make it overflow; the subterranean crannies and passages
          of this leaky vessel not being able with the encreased pressure from above, to carry off
          the water as fast as it is poured in; but this happens only about six or seven times in
          twenty years. *</p>
        <p>Having satisfied our curiosity in viewing this wonder of nature, and moralized on the
          insignificancy of all human attempts in producing any thing like it, we ascended into our
          native regions and proceeded to another called <placeName><w rend="italics">Douk-cove</w></placeName>, about a
          mile south, on the other side of the turnpike road, towards the foot of <placeName><w rend="italics"
            >Ingleborough</w></placeName>, whose height now appeared to great advantage from the nature of our
          own elevated situation. <placeName><w rend="italics">Douk-cove</w></placeName> is something similar to that of <placeName><w
            rend="italics">Weathercoate</w></placeName>, but not heightened so much with the vast and terrible;
          The cavity indeed is longer and wider, but not deeper; the rocks not so high and steep,
          except on the east side, where the hawks and other birds build their nests, not dreading
          the approach of human foot. They both seem once to have</p>
        <p><seg type="pagesignature">S 2</seg> been</p>
        <p>* The owner of the cave says that it run over in the back end of the year <label><date>1757</date></label> before
          Christmas, in <label><date>1759</date></label>, in <label><date>1771</date></label> two or three times, and all in the back end of the year; and
          in <label><date>February 1782</date></label> and <label><date>November 1783</date></label>. But during this interval, the water has been several
          times near the top of the caves Before it runs over a large stream issues out of the well
          before the <placeName><w rend="italics">Weathercoate-house</w></placeName>.</p>

        <p>been covered over like <placeName><w rend="italics">Yordas</w></placeName>, but the roofs to have fallen in by
          some inundation or other accident. The stream of this cascade does not fall above five or
          six yards, and is not so large as the former; though like it, is immediately absorbed
          amongst the rocks beneath. The subterranean passage out of which it issued is very
          curious. By the help of a ladder we ascended and went along it to some distance by means
          of candles: When we had gone about forty or fifty yards, we came to a chasm twelve or
          fifteen yards in depth from the surface, through which we could see broad day, How far we
          could have proceeded, we know not; we returned, after we had been about a hundred yards.
          This would be looked on as a great curiosity in many countries; but after those we had
          seen, our wonder was not easily excited. No doubt but another subterranean passage might
          be discovered by ridding away the rubbish at the bottom of the cave where the water
          sinks.</p>
        <p>We were now on the base or pediment on which <placeName><w rend="italics">Ingleborough</w></placeName> * stands,
          and greatly elevated above all the western country. Our distance from the bottom, where
          the steep ascent of this high mountain begins, was about a mile in a direct horizontal
          line over rocks and pits. The fineness and clearness however of the day induced us to
          ascend its sides and gain its summit: Though we had many a weary and slippery step, we
          thought ourselves amply repaid when we got to the top, with the amusement we received in
          viewing the several extensive and diversified prospects, and in making our observations as
          botanists and natural historians, on its productions and contents. All the country betwixt
          us and the sea, to the extent of forty, fifty, and sixty miles from the north-west, by the
          west to the south-west, lay stretched out</p>
        <p>beneath</p>
        <p>* The word <placeName><w rend="italics">Ingleborough</w></placeName> seems to be derived from the <trait type="ethnicity">

        <p>beneath us, like a large map, with the roads, rivers, villages, towns, seats, hiils and
          vales, capes and bays, in succession. Elevation is a great leveller; all the hills and
          little mountains in the country before us, appeared sunk in our eyes, and in the same
          plane with the adjacent meadows. To the northwest, the prospect was terminated at the
          distance of forty or fifty miles, by a chain of rugged mountains in <hi rend="italics"
            ><placeName>Westmorland</placeName>, <placeName>Lancashire</placeName>,</hi> and <placeName><w rend="italics">Cumberland</w></placeName>, which appeared as
          barriers against the fury of the ocean. To the west the <trait type="ethnicity">
            
            <label>Irish</label>
          </trait> sea extends as far as the
          eye can penetrate, except where the uniformity of the watery prospect is interrupted by
          the <placeName><hi rend="italics">Isle of Man</hi></placeName> and <placeName><w rend="italics">Anglesey</w></placeName>. The blue
          mountains in <placeName><w rend="italics">Wales</w></placeName> terminated our further progress, after we had
          traced out the winding of the coast all the way from <placeName><w rend="italics">Lancaster</w></placeName>, by
            <placeName><w rend="italics">Preston</w></placeName>, and <placeName><w rend="italics">Liverpool</w></placeName>. A curious <hi
            rend="italics">deceptio visus</hi> presented itself: All the vales between us and the
          sea appeared lower than its surface; owing to the sky and earth both apparently tending to
          a line drawn from the eye parallel to the horizon, where they at last appeared to meet. To
          the east and north, the prospect was soon terminated by a number of black, irregular,
          chaotic mountains, which by their indentations and winding summits, gave us reason to
          conclude they contained habitable vales between them. Their sides afford an hardy and
          wholesome pastare for sheep, and their bowels contain rich mines of lead, some of which
          are wrought with great advantage to the proprietors.</p>
        <p>The immense base on which <placeName><w rend="italics">Ingleborough</w></placeName> stands, is between twenty
          and thirty miles in circumference: The rise is in some places even and gradual, in others,
          as to the north and west, it is rugged and almost perpendicular. The top is plain and
          horizontal, being almost a mile round, having the ruins of an old wall about it, from
          which some ingenious antiquaries endeavour to prove that it has once been a <trait type="ethnicity">
            
            <label>Roman</label>
          </trait> station,
          and place of great defence. Of late years it has never been frequented by any except
          shepherds, and the curious in prospects, and the neighbouring country people, who resorted

        <p>horse races, which were formerly annually held on its top. On the western edge there are
          the remains of what the country people call the beacon, some three or four yards high,
          ascended by a flight of steps. The ruins of a little watch-house is also adjoining: No
          doubt in time of wars, insurrections, and tumults, and particularly during the incursions
          of the <trait type="ethnicity">
            
            <label>Scots</label>
          </trait>, a fire was made on this beacon to give the alarm to the country round about.
          The soil on the top is so dry and barren that it affords little grass, the rock being
          barely covered with earth: A spongy moss is all the vegetable that thrives in this lofty
          region. The stones on the summit, and for a great way down, are of the sandy gritty sort,
          with freestone slate amongst them: Upon the base, the rocks are all limestone to an
          enormous depth. Near the top indeed, on the east side, is a stratum of limestone like the
            <placeName><w rend="italics">Derbyshire</w></placeName> marble full of entrochi. Several springs have their
          origin near the summit, particularly one on the north side, of pure and well-tasted water,
          called <placeName><w rend="italics">Fair-weather-syke</w></placeName>, which runs down by the side of sheep-fence
          wall into a chasm called <placeName><w rend="italics">Meir-gill</w></placeName>. All the other springs, as well
          as this, when they come to the limestone base are swallowed up, and, after running perhaps
          a mile underground, make their appearance once again in the surrounding vales, and then
          wind in various courses to the <placeName><w rend="italics">Lune</w></placeName> or <placeName><w rend="italics">Ribble</w></placeName>,
          which empty themselves into the <trait type="ethnicity">
            
            <label>Irish</label>
          </trait> sea.</p>
        <p>A naturalist cannot but observe a number of conical holes with their vertexes downwards,
          not only all over the base of <placeName><w rend="italics">Ingleborough</w></placeName>, but particularly a row
          near the summit. They are from two to four or five yards diameter, and from two to three
          or four yards deep, except <w rend="italics">Barefoot-wives-hole</w> hereafter mentioned
          which is much larger. They resemble these pits about <placeName>mount <hi rend="italics">AEtna,

        <p>The perpendicular height of this mountain above the level of the sea is 3987 feet, as

        <p>In our return we visited the long, deep, and dreadful chasm of <placeName><w rend="italics"
            >Meir-gill</w></placeName>, on the west side of the sheep-fence wall, running north and south over
          the base of <placeName><w rend="italics">Ingleborough</w></placeName>: It is about eighty yards long, but in most
          places so narrow that a person may stride over it, and is no where above two or three
          yards wide; in one place there is a curious natural bridge over it. The depth is very
          different, in different places: at one place we found it a hundred feet, forty eight of
          which was in the water. One part will admit a bold and active adventurer down almost to
          the water by a gradual, but slippery descent: Here the shadow of the superincumbent rocks,
          like that in <placeName><w rend="italics">Hurtlepot</w></placeName>, forms a very deceitful appearance in the
          water: The bottom seems not above two feet below the surface; but how fatal would be the
          attempt to wade this abyss in quest of farther discoveries, from this shadow of
          encouragement? The narrowness of this crevice at the top has something dreadful and
          alarming in it: How fatal would one false step prove to the unwary shepherd amongst the
          snow, when the mouth is drifted up; or to a ranger bewildered in the fog, and looking
          forwards with eager eyes for some habitation, or frequented path? Harmless and heedless
          sheep have often been suddenly swallowed up by this gaping wonder of nature. To say that
          no living creature ever came out of its womb, would be a proposition too general. Trouts
          of a protuberant size have been drawn out of it, where they had long been nourished in
          safety, their habitation being seldom disturbed by the insidious <roleName>fisherman</roleName>.</p>
        <p>A little further to the east we came to another curiosity of nature, called <w
            rend="italics">Barfoot-wives-hole</w>: We had noticed it in our ascent up the side of <placeName><w
            rend="italics">Ingleborough</w></placeName>. It is a large round pit in form of a funnel, the
          diameter at top being about fifty or sixty yards, and its depth twenty six. It is easily
          descended in most places, though on the south side there is an high rocky precipice, but
          is dry, the waters that are emptied into it, being swallowed up among the rocks and loose
          stones at the bottom. In our way back we also saw <placeName><w rend="italics">Hardrawkin</w></placeName>,
          and</p>

        <p>some other subterranean passages of less note, which had been formed by the waters In
          their descent from the mountain adjoining to <placeName><w rend="italics">Ingleborough</w></placeName> to the
          vale beneath. Indeed the whole limestone base of this monster of nature is perforated and
          excavated in all directions like a honeycomb.*</p>
        <p>From the <placeName><hi rend="italics">Chapel in the dale</hi></placeName>, we shaped our course towards the
          south-east corner of <placeName><w rend="italics">Whernside</w></placeName>, along the road leading to the
          village of <placeName><w rend="italics">Dent</w></placeName>. As we proceeded, the curate entertained us with an
          account of some singular properties observable in the black earth, which composes the soil
          in the higher parts of the vale, in various morassy places. It is a kind of <hi
            rend="italics">igneum lutum</hi>, or rather a sort of putrified earth, which in the
          night resembles fire, when it is agitated by being trod upon: The effects it produces in a
          dark evening are truly curious and amazing. Strangers are always surprised, and often
          frightened, to see their own and horses legs besprinkled to all appearance with fire, and
          sparks of it flying in every direction, as if struck out of the ground from under their
          feet. They are as much alarmed with it, as the <roleName>country people</roleName> are with the <hi
            rend="italics">will with the wisp</hi>, or mariners with the luminous vapour of the
          delapsed <hi rend="italics">Castor and Pollux</hi>. Though the dark and dreary moor is
          broke into thousands of luminous particles, like so many glow-worms, when troubled by the
          <roleName>benighted traveller</roleName>, yet if any part of this natural phosphorus is brought before a
          lighted candle, its splendour immediately vanishes, and it shrinks back into its original
          dull and dark state of sordid dirt. While we were endeavouring to account for this curious
          phenomenon on the principles of putrifaction and electricity, we arrived at the first
          object of this lateral ex-</p>
        <p>cursion</p>
        <p>* Limestone has all the appearance of having being once in a soft state and easily
          soluble in water; this principle will account for the scallops on the surface of limestone
          rocks, being made perhaps by the water draining off, while the stone was soft; also for
          the chinks and crevices amongst them, made by their shrinking together, when dried by the
          sun. The caves themselves proceed from a great part of the rock, most probably being
          dissolved and washed down by the streams pervading tha different strata.</p>

          gentleman's garden or park. All the ground about seemed hollow and we saw various chasms
          and empty spaces between the strata of rocks, though none worth a particular description

        <p>Over the cave, where the water flows, is another subterranean passage, of about twenty
          four feet in length, and from three to ten in height: It enters the other obliquely, and
          looks like a natural orchestra, and where indeed a band of music would exhibit to great
          advantage to an audience below. The roof of the cave at the entrance by the stream is
          about two yards high but soon increases to six. When we had proceeded out of sight of day,
          a new train of ideas were excited in our imaginations. We could not but fancy that it was
          like the cave of <persName> <w rend="italics">Polypheme</w></persName>, or of some giant in modern romance, who
          hung up the mangled limbs of the unhappy victims that fell into his hands, to the dome of
          his murky den. From the roof were pendent large petrifactions in every grotesque shape;
          some like hams, others like neat's tongues, many like the heads and various parts of
          different animals. Some parts of this cave appeared like dreary vaults or catacombs, where
          were deposited the reliques of antient heroes, or martyrs. Some rocks at the bottom
          appeared like huge stone coffins, and some large petrifactions on the shelves like virgins
          or children represented in alabaster. As we proceeded along we met with several bye
          streets or lanes, down some of which came tinkling little currents, but they seemed not to
          admit a passenger with ease to any great distance: As we went along we observed that the
          way divided for a considerable part of the whole length into two main streets, which
          united again, made by the current dividing above into two streams. After we had gone near
          an hundred yards we met with an orifice, which easily admitted us above ground: We had no
          curiosity to explore any farther, as the roof was now become only some four feet high, and

          the main stream of <placeName>the river <w rend="italics">Greta</w></placeName>, winch runs underground for at
          least two miles, making its appearance here, at <placeName><w rend="italics">Weathercoate</w></placeName>, and a
          few other places in its way down to its open channel. The pools that are formed by the
          brook after its exit out of the cave, exhibit a pleasing and rural scene, being shaded
          with rocks, weeping willows, and mountain ash.</p>

        <p>Having travelled a mile or two farther, and passed through the little remote village of
            <placeName><w rend="italics">Winterscales</w></placeName>, we came to the natural curiosity we were in quest
          of, <placeName><w rend="italics">Greenside-cave</w></placeName>: It is under the south-east corner of the lofty
          mountain <placeName><w rend="italics">Whernside</w></placeName>: The mouth was wide and high, and the road
          rugged; but the roof gradually sunk, or the bottom arose, till it was troublesome getting
          along, soon after we were out of sight of day. A small brook ran along the bottom, as in
          the other caves, but there were none of the curious petrifactions we saw in most of them
          to delight the eye. <persName><w rend="italics">Churchill</w></persName>'s description of the Caledonian cave
          of famine, with a few alterations, will convey a just idea of <w rend="italics"
            >Greenside-cave</w>.</p>
        <lg>
          <l>This lonely cave (hard tax on <trait type="ethnicity">
            
            <label>Scottish</label>
          </trait> pride!)</l>
          <l>Shelter at once for man and beast supply'd:</l>
          <l>Their snares without, entangling briers spread,</l>
          <l>And thistles arm'd against th' invaders head:</l>
          <l>Here webs were spread of more than common size,</l>
          <l>And half starv'd spiders prey'd on half starv'd flies;</l>
          <l>In quest of food, efts strove in vain to crawl,</l>
          <l>Slugs, pinch'd with hunger, smear'd the slimy wall—</l>
          <l>The cave around with falling rivulets rung,</l>
          <l>And on the roof unhealthy vapours hung.</l>
        </lg>
        <p>Near the mouth of this cave is a thin stratum of coal, not many inches thick: Some
          attempts have been made to work it, but affording so small gains, and the inhabitants
          being so well supplied with this article from <placeName><w rend="italics">Ingleton</w></placeName>, it was soon
          deserted. Being so near the top of <placeName><w rend="italics">Whernside</w></placeName>, we ventured to ascend
          to the summit. The prospects were not diversified with many pleasing objects, being
          surrounded almost on all sides with brown and blue chaotic mountains. We had a peep into
          the pleasant vale of <placeName><w rend="italics">Dent</w></placeName> beneath us, which made us wish to see it
          all. <placeName><w rend="italics">Pendle-hill</w></placeName> appeared over the top of <placeName><w rend="italics"
            >Ingleborough</w></placeName>, which gave us an high idea of our own elevation, this latter mountain
          being much higher than the former. We were surprised to see four or five tarns or pools of
          water,</p>

        <p>on a plain very near the summit of <placeName><w rend="italics">Whernside</w></placeName>. Two of them were
          large, being two or three hundred yards in length, and nearly of the same breadth; for one
          was almost circular, but the other oblong. There was a very thin bed of coal almost on the
          top of this mountain, and we were told, another corresponded with it on the top of the
          great <placeName><w rend="italics">Cohn</w></placeName>, a lofty mountain on the other side of that branch of the
          vale of <placeName><w rend="italics">Dent</w></placeName> called <placeName><w rend="italics">Dibdale</w></placeName>. We were told some
          curious anecdotes of the vast cunning and sagacity of the sheep dogs in this country, in
          discovering the sheep that had been buried under large drifts of snow for some days, and
          that must inevitably have perished with hunger, or been drowned with the melting of that
          vapour, if not discovered by these useful animals.</p>
        <p>We now shaped our course back to <placeName><w rend="italics">Winterscales</w></placeName>, and from thence to a
          public-house called <placeName><w rend="italics">Gearstones</w></placeName>, by the side of the turnpike road, at
          the bottom of the mountain <placeName><w rend="italics">Cam</w></placeName>. Here we refreshed ourselves and left
          our horses, while we went about half a mile to the south, to explore another subterranean
          wonder of nature called <placeName><w rend="italics">Catknot-hole</w></placeName>. The entrance into it at first
          is not above three or four feet high, but almost immediately encreases to as many yards.
          We had not gone out of sight of day, before we were obliged to wade up to the mid-leg a
          few yards, through a little pool made by the rill, that comes out of this cave. The
          passage grew narrower, but wide enough to walk along with ease, except in one or two
          places, where we were in danger of daubing our cloaths with a red slime. We proceeded
          above a quarter of a mile, when the road grew wider, but the roof was so low, that we
          could not go on with ease and pleasure: Pernaps if we had mustered humility and fortitude
          enough, to have crouched and crawled a little, we might have come to where the roof again
          would have been as high as we should have desired. In some places there were alleys out of
          the main street, but not extending to any great distance, so as to admit of passengers.
          The rocks jutted out, and were pendant in every grotesque and fantastic shape; most of
          them were</p>
        <p>covered</p>
        <pb n="287" facs="809.jp2"/>
        <p><seg type="pagenumber">270</seg> ADDENDA.</p>
        <p>covered over with a fine coating of spar, that looked like alabaster, while icicles of
          various shapes and colours were pendant from the roof; all generated by the fine particles
          of stone that exist in the water, which transudes through the the roof and sides, and
          leaves them adhering to the rock in their descent to the bottom. The various coloured
          reflections made by the spars and petrifactions that abounded in every part, entertained
          the eye with the greatest novelty and variety; while at the same time, the different notes
          made by the rill in its little cascades, and reverberated from the hollow rocks, amused
          the ear with a new sort of rude and subterranean music, but well enough suited to our slow
          and gloomy march. This was the longest subterranean excursion we had yet made, and if we
          might have formed our own computation of its extent, from the time we were in going and
          coming, and not from the real admeasurement of our guide, we should have thought it two or
          three times as long as it was; so much were we deceived in our estimate of a road, unlike
          any we had ever before travelled. The romantic cascades, pools, and precipices in the
          channel of <placeName>the river <w rend="italics">Ribble</w></placeName>, that runs by the mouth of this cave,
          are not unworthy the notice of a stranger.</p>
        <p>We were in some suspence whether we should pursue the turnpike road over <placeName><w
            rend="italics">Cam</w></placeName>, to see the natural curiosities in <w rend="italics"
            >Wensleydale</w>: But as we learnt there was only one remarkable object of the genus of
          those we were now in quest of, <placeName><w rend="italics">Hardraw-scar</w></placeName>, we desisted; as we
          should have lost others more valuable, which lay in a different route. The description,
          however, which was given of it by our reverend guide, was so lively and picturesque, that
          its own merit will be a sufficient apology for its insertion.</p>
        <p>"<placeName><w rend="italics">Hardraw-scar</w></placeName> is near the town of <placeName><w rend="italics">Hawes</w></placeName>, in
            <placeName><w rend="italics">Wensleydale</w></placeName>, and bears some distant affinity to the tremendous <placeName><w
            rend="italics">Gordal</w></placeName> (hereafter taken notice of.) The chasm is pervious at the
          bottom, and extends above three hundred yards in length,</p>

        <pb n="288" facs="810.jp2"/>
        <p>ADDENDA. <seg type="pagenumber">271</seg></p>
        <p>fortified with huge shattered rocks on each side, which are in some places thirty three
          yards perpendicular, and the intervallum above eighty. At the far end is an amazing
          cataract, which pours forth a vast quantity of water, that falls into a deep bason. Behind
          the water-fall is a deep recess excavated out of the solid rock: Here the spectator may
          stand behind the stream secure from its madefying effects, and may go quite round it upon
          one of the numerous <hi rend="italics">jaxa fedilia</hi>, at the distance of ten yards
          from the water. In the year 1740, when fairs were held on the <placeName><w rend="italics"
          >Thames</w></placeName>, this cascade was frozen and constituted a prodigious icicle of a conic form,
          thirty two yards and three quarters in circumference which was also its height."</p>
        <p>After having determined to go by <placeName><w rend="italics">Settle</w></placeName>, we had our doubt, whether
          we should proceed by <placeName><w rend="italics">Ling-gill</w></placeName>, which is a curious and romantic
          channel of a small river, having high and grotesque rocks on each side; or take a more
          western direction on the other side of <placeName>the river <w rend="italics">Ribble</w></placeName>, in order to
          see some other caves and chasms. Our taste for curiosities of this sort induced us to
          adopt the latter plan. We returned about a mile before we left the turnpike road, and then
          turning off to the left, proceeding almost to the same distance, we came to <w
            rend="italics">Alan</w> or <placeName><w rend="italics">Alumn-pot</w></placeName>, two or three furlongs above
          the little village of <placeName><w rend="italics">Selside</w></placeName>. It is a round steep hole in the
          limestone rock, about eight or ten yards in diameter, and of a tremendous depth, somewhat
          resembling <placeName><w rend="italics">Elden-hole</w></placeName>, in <placeName><w rend="italics">Derbyshire</w></placeName>. We stood
          for some time on its margin, which is fringed round with shrubs, in silent astonishment,
          not thinking it safe to venture near enough to its brim, to try if we could see to its
          bottom. The profundity seemed vast and horrible from the continued hollow gingling noise,
          excited by the stones we tumbled into it. We plummed it to the depth of a hundred and
          sixty five feet, forty three of which were in water, and this is an extraordinary dry
          season: As the direction of this hole was not exactly perpendicular but somewhat sloping,
          it is very probable we were not quite at</p>
        <p>the</p>

        <p>the bottom. A subterranean rivulet descends into this terrible hiatus, which caused such
          a dreadful gloom from the spray it raised up as to make us shrink back with horror, when
          we could get a peep into the vast abyss. We were informed, that not long since some
          animals, an ox and a calf at different times, had the misfortune to tumble into this
          dreary pit, being tempted by the untasted herbage to venture too far on its slippery
          margin. Only a low mound of earth surrounds its brim; for a stone wall would answer no
          other purpose, than to afford the <roleName>curious traveller</roleName> materials to throw in for his
          amusement. Any advantage arising from the skins and carcases of these animals, were not
          sufficient inducements to tempt a neighbouring adventurous youth to be let down by ropes
          to the bottom of this frightful chasm. The waters run from its bottom above a mile
          underground, and then appear again in the open air, below the little village of <placeName><w
            rend="italics">Selside</w></placeName>. After having excited the several passions of curiosity,
          dread, and horror, from the negative knowledge we got of the capacity and depth of this
          huge pot, we went a little higher up the mountain, and came to another hiatus called <placeName><w
            rend="italics">Long-churn</w></placeName>. We descended down till we came to a subterranean brook:
          We first ascended the cavern, down which the stream ran, proceeding in a western
          direction, for at least, as we imagined, a quarter of a mile, till we came to a crevice
          which admitted us into our native region. We measured the distance between the two
          extremities above ground, and found it two hundred and forty one yards, but it must be
          nearly double that distance along the passage below, on account of all the turnings and
          windings. The petrifactions here were the most numerous of any we had yet feen, few people
          coming hither to break them off or deface them. When we were almost arrived at the western
          extremity, we came to a fine round bason of pellucid water, from three to twelve feet
          deep, known by the name of <hi rend="italics"><persName>Dr. Bannister</persName>'s hand bason</hi>. A lofty,
          spacious, and elegant dome is placed immediately over it, which nicely corresponds to the
          hollowed receptacle at the bottom: Into</p>
        <p>this</p>
        <pb n="290" facs="812.jp2"/>
        <p>ADDENDA. <seg type="pagenumber">273</seg></p>
        <p>this bason a rivulet falls down a steep rock above six feet high, which is very dangerous
          to get up, and must be done at the expence of a wet skin, except a ladder is taken along
          with the party, or the waters are less copious, than when we were there: There is also
          some danger lest the adventurer should fall back, and have his bones broken by
          circumjacent rocks, or be drowned in the doctor's bason. After having surmounted this
          obstacle, and proceeded some yards farther, we were favoured with an egress into our own
          element, as was before observed; no unwelcome change, after having been so long excluded
          from it. After having-rested ourselves a little, we returned to the chasm, where we first
          entered <placeName><w rend="italics">Long-churn</w></placeName>, and descending again, pursued the rivulet
          east-ward along another extensive subterranean passage, called <placeName><w rend="italics"
            >Dicken-pot</w></placeName>, which slopes and winds by degrees till it enters the ghastly and
          tremendous <placeName><w rend="italics">Alan-pot</w></placeName>. We went a hundred and fifty seven yards along
          this <hi rend="italics">antre vast</hi> till we came to a steep rock full twelve feet
          perpendicular: Here we stopped; a wise consideration! We might have descended perhaps
          without danger, but the question was how we were to get up again; which, without ropes or
          a ladder, would be totally impracticable: At the far end was an elegant lofty dome called
          by the <roleName>country people</roleName> <placeName><hi rend="italics">St. Paul's</hi></placeName>. There is no doubt, but if we had
          ventured farther, we might have come to <placeName><w rend="italics">Alan-pot</w></placeName>, at least so near,
          as either to have seen the water that stagnates at its bottom, or the light that is
          admitted into this gaping monster of nature.</p>
        <p>There are several other caves all along from hence on the south side of <placeName><w rend="italics"
            >Ingleborough</w></placeName>, above the village of <placeName><w rend="italics">Clapham</w></placeName>, to <placeName><w
            rend="italics">Ingleton</w></placeName>: But we postponed the pleasure of exploring these hidden
          recesses of nature till another summer. We descended from hence along the banks of <placeName>the
          river <w rend="italics">Ribble</w></placeName> four or five miles farther to <placeName>the village of <w
            rend="italics">Horton</w></placeName>, situated at the bottom of the lofty and elegant mountain <placeName><w
            rend="italics">Penegent</w></placeName>. As we went along we passed a large heap of small round
          stones, called an <w rend="italics">hurder</w>: We were told there were two other by the

        <p>the turnpike road, in a field called the <w rend="italics">Slights</w>, one about a mile,
          and the others a mile and a half east of the <placeName><hi rend="italics">Chapel in the dale</hi></placeName>.
          They seem evidently placed there by human hands, and what was most extraordinary, they
          were all small, round, sandy, and gritty stones, and all the stones on the surface of the
          ground near them are limestone. No doubt they were <w rend="italics">tumuli</w> of some
          deceased chieftains in the neighbourhood, or who died on their travels.</p>
        <p>Before we left <placeName><w rend="italics">Horton</w></placeName> we visited some natural curiosities of the
          cavern kind on the base of <placeName><w rend="italics">Penegent</w></placeName>.* <placeName><w rend="italics"
            >Dowgill-scar</w></placeName>, a little above <placeName><w rend="italics">Horton</w></placeName> is a grotesque
          amphitheatre os limestone rocks composing an high precipice, which must appear awful and
          grand in a flood, when a large torrent of water falls from the top, full in view: A small
          subterranean passage was able to take all the water, when we were there. A romantic
          gallery on the north side of the rocks, had a good effect in the scene. About a mile or
          two above <placeName><w rend="italics">Horton</w></placeName>, upon the base of <placeName><w rend="italics">Penegent</w></placeName>,
          we visited <placeName><w rend="italics">Hulpit</w></placeName>, and <placeName><hi rend="italics">Huntpit holes</hi></placeName>: The
          one, is we could have descended into it, would have appeared like the inside of an
          enormous old Gothic castle, the high ruinous walls of which were left standing after the
          roof was fallen in. The other was like a deep funnel, and it was dangerous to come near
          its edges. <placeName><w rend="italics">Horton-beck</w></placeName> or <w rend="italics">brook</w> runs through
          the one, and <placeName><w rend="italics">Bransil-beck</w></placeName> through the other of these pits, but
          through which I cannot remember; they each run underground near a mile; <placeName><w rend="italics"

          But what is most extraordinary, these subterranean brooks cross each other underground
          without mixing waters, the bed of one being on a stratum above the other; This was</p>

          the right, along the road towards <placeName><w rend="italics">Kirkby-Lonsdale</w></placeName>, about a mile,
          under the high and romantic rocks called <placeName><hi rend="italics">Giggleswick scar</hi></placeName>; in
          order to see the well by the way side, that ebbs and flows. We were in luck, seeing it
          reciprocate several times while we were there, and not staying above an hour. We could not
          however learn, with any degree of certainty, by what intervals of time, and to what
          heights and depths the reciprocation was carried on. We were informed that if the weather
          was either very droughty or very wet, the phaenomenon ceased. I have seen some
          philosophical attempts to solve this extraordinary curiosity on the principle of the
          syphon, but in vain; as on that hypothesis, if the syphon is filled by the spring, it will
          slow on uniformly for ever. We were told by <persName>drunken <w rend="italics">Barnaby</w></persName>, an
          hundred and fifty years ago, that it puzzled the wits of his age.</p>

        <p>As we approached towards <placeName><w rend="italics">Settle</w></placeName>, in our return, a white rock like a
          tower, called <placeName><w rend="italics">Castleber</w></placeName>, immediately above the town, and about
          twenty or thirty yards in perpendicular height, engaged our attention. This precipice is
          partly natural and partly a work of art; it is made deeper and more dangerous every day in
          consequence of stones being got from its bottom and sides to supply an adjoining lime
          kiln.</p>
        <p><placeName><w rend="italics">Settle</w></placeName> is irregularly built, has a large and spacious marketplace,
          but not many good houses in it: Though by no means an inconsiderable town either for
          trade, riches or number of inhabitants, it has no church or chapel. The church is at <placeName><w
            rend="italics">Giggleswick</w></placeName>, about a mile off, which appeared to be the court end of
          the parish consisting chiefly of gentlemens houses.</p>
        <p>From <placeName><w rend="italics">Settle</w></placeName> we proceeded eastward over the moors and mountains
          about half a dozen miles, to <placeName><w rend="italics">Malham</w></placeName> or <w rend="italics">Maum</w>,
          in order to see some other natural curiosities of the precipice and cataract kind. We had
          already indeed seen so many, that our wonder could not easily be excited, except there
          were more great and terrible: As such we had them represented at <placeName><w rend="italics"
            >Settle</w></placeName>, or else we should scarce have left the turnpike road; and when we saw them
          we were not disappointed, for great and terrible they are. The first was <placeName><w
            rend="italics">Malham-cave</w></placeName> (or vulgarly <w rend="italics">Maum-cove</w>) though I;
          has properly nothing of the cave a-</p>

        <p>ADDENDA. <seg type="pagenumber">277</seg></p>
        <p>bout it. It is a fine amphitheatre of perpendicular limestone rock on the side of the
          moor, at least a hundred yards high in the middle. The rocks lie stratum upon stratum, and
          on some there are <hi rend="italics">saxa sedilia</hi> or theives, so that a person of
          great spirit and agility, but of small and slender body, might almost walk round. A small
          brook springs out at the bottom of the rocks; but in floods the narrow subterranean
          passage is not able to give vent to all the water, when there pours down a stupendous
          cataract, in height almost double that of <placeName><w rend="italics">Niagara</w></placeName>. This is the
          highest perpendicular precipice I have ever seen, and I think not enough known or admired
          by <roleName>travellers</roleName> for its greatness and regularity. After pursuing our journey near a mile, by
          the side of the deep and romantic channel of <placeName>the river <w rend="italics">Air</w></placeName>, which
          washes the base of many a rugged and high precipice in its impetuous course to the vale
          beneath, we came to <placeName><w rend="italics">Gordale</w></placeName>, the highest and most stupendous of them
          all. The prospect of it from the side of the opposite western bank is awful, great and
          grand. After viewing for some time its horrid front with wonder and astonishment, we were
          tempted to descend with care and circumspection down the steep bank on the west side to
          this river, which being interspersed with trees and shrubs, enabled us to rely on our
          hands, where we could find no sure foot hold. The water being low we met with no
          difficulty in stepping from one broken fragment of the rocks to another, till we got on
          the other side, when we found ourselves underneath this huge impending block of solid
          limestone, near a hundred yards high. The idea for personal safety excited some awful
          sensations accompanied with a tremor. The mind is not always able to divest itself of
          prejudices and unpleasing associations of ideas: Reason told us that this rock could not
          be moved out of its place by human force, blind chance, or the established laws of nature.
          We stood too far under its margin to be affected by any crumbling descending fragment, and
          a very small one would have crushed us to atoms, if it had fallen upon us; yet in spite of
          reason and judgment, the same unpleasing sensations of terror ran coldly through our
          veins,</p>

        <p>which we should have felt, if we had looked down, though secure, from its lofty top.
          Nothing however fell upon us but a few large drops, which sweat from out its horrid
          prominent front. Some goats frisked about with seemingly a wanton carelesness, on the
          brink of this dreadful precipice, where none of us would have stood for all the pleasant
          vales washed by <placeName>the river <w rend="italics">Air</w></placeName>. Some lines in <hi rend="italics"
            ><persName>Virgil</persName>'s Eclogues</hi> seemed to received additional beauties when repeated in this
          grotesque scene.</p>

        <p>A little higher up is a fine cascade, where the river striving for an easier and gentler
          descent, has forced a way through the rocks, leaving a rude natural arch remaining above.
          If a painter wanted to have embellished his drawing of this romantic scene with some
          grotesque object, he could have added nothing which would have suited his purpose better,
          if nature had not done the work for him.</p>
        <p>* From <placeName><w rend="italics">Gordale</w></placeName> we proceeded to a curious lake called <w
            rend="italics">Maum</w> or <placeName><w rend="italics">Malham-tarn</w></placeName>, abounding with fine trout,
          upon the top of the moor; and from thence by <placeName><w rend="italics">Kilsey-crag</w></placeName> to <placeName><w
            rend="italics">Grassington</w></placeName>, on the banks of <placeName>the river <w rend="italics">Wharf</w></placeName>.
          Coming unexpectedly to the crags of <placeName><w rend="italics">Kilsey</w></placeName>, I was a good deal amazed
          at the prospect. They are by the side of the vale, along which descends <placeName>the river <w

        <p>to some distance, but are higher and more prominent. The road we came along winding down
          amongst these crags, so that we were presented with a full view of them on a sudden, which
          caused the greater surprise. After having refreshed ourselves at <placeName><w rend="italics"
            >Grassington</w></placeName>, we travelled about nine miles further and came to <placeName><w rend="italics"
            >Skipton</w></placeName>. The country all round us is uneven and rugged; the vales are fertile on
          the surface, and the mountains beneath it abound with rich mines of lead. After we had
          visited the castle (which belongs to <persName>the Earl of <w rend="italics">Thanet</w></persName>) and the
          curious canal behind it, above the mills, which, leads to the limestone quarry, by the
          side of a romantic deep glen, we left <placeName><w rend="italics">Skipton</w></placeName>. Before our departure
          we were for some time in doubt, whether we should ascend the steep and black hill of <placeName><w
            rend="italics">Rombaldsmoor</w></placeName>, and so proceed down the vale of <placeName><w rend="italics"
            >Whardale</w></placeName>, one of the pleasantest in <placeName><w rend="italics">England</w></placeName>, to <placeName><w
            rend="italics">Otley</w></placeName>, and so to <placeName><w rend="italics">Leeds</w></placeName>,—or go by <hi
            rend="italics"><placeName>Keighley</placeName>, <placeName>Bingley</placeName></hi>, and <w rend="italics">Bradford</w>, along the
          side of the new canal, and, view the locks and other contrivances on this new and useful
          work of art. Most of us having been the former road, and this with its objects being quite
          new, we were induced to proceed along it. At <placeName><w rend="italics">Kildwick</w></placeName>, about four
          miles from <placeName><w rend="italics">Skipton</w></placeName>, we passed under this aquaeduct, where it was
          banked up a great height above the adjoining lands at a vast labour and expence; there
          have been some violent struggles between the elements of earth and water; the mounds have
          not always been able to keep the water within its proper limits, they having, oftner than
          once, been broken through by the pressure on their sides. About a mile further at <placeName><w
            rend="italics">Steeton</w></placeName>, we could not but observe the steep ascent and descent of the
          road over a hill, when a level path might have been made almost equally near along the
          side of the river. The inconveniences that must attend carriage in carts and waggons, from
          such ill-concerted roads, perhaps might suggest the expediency of a canal. The use and
          practicability of such an undertaking in a mountainous country, one would imagine might
          give the inhabitants a hint to make their roads wind with easy ascents and descents along
          the sides of the vale. From <placeName><w rend="italics">Skipton</w></placeName> to <placeName><w rend="italics">Otley</w></placeName>,
          the road is carried up and down</p>

        <p>the corner of the steep mountain <placeName><w rend="italics">Rombaldsmoor</w></placeName>, when as near a one
          might have been conducted along the vale beneath. The inhabitants might have carried to
          the market the produce of their lands, and brought coals and manure at a little expence,
          if this plan had been adopted; but the prejudices against improvements and innovations are
          not easily removed. At <placeName><w rend="italics">Bingley</w></placeName> we were entertained with the locks;
          there are five or six of them together, where the barges ascend or descend eighty or
          ninety feet perpendicular, in the distance of about a hundred yards They are elegant and
          well finished, but seem too deep not to leak and be frequently out of repair. The act was
          procured some eight or ten years ago, to make a navigable canal from <placeName><w rend="italics"
            >Leeds</w></placeName> up to <placeName><w rend="italics">Skipton</w></placeName>, and <placeName><w rend="italics">Colne</w></placeName>, and
          from thence by <placeName><w rend="italics">Whalley</w></placeName>, <placeName><w rend="italics">Layland</w></placeName>, and <placeName><w
            rend="italics">Ormskirk</w></placeName>, to <placeName><w rend="italics">Liverpool</w></placeName>, being quite across the
          kingdom. As in most works of this nature, which are extensive and of a new kind, the
          estimate fell far short of the expence. Only the two extremities are finished at present,
          from <placeName><w rend="italics">Leeds</w></placeName> to about four miles above <placeName><w rend="italics">Skipton</w></placeName>,
          at one end, and from <placeName><w rend="italics">Liverpool</w></placeName> to <placeName><w rend="italics">Wigan</w></placeName> on the
          other. If the whole was completed, no doubt but it would prove of public and national
          advantage. Like, that of the new river to <placeName><w rend="italics">London</w></placeName>, undertakings of
          this sort often ruin the first adventurers, and make the fortunes of those who are able to
          complete and extend the original plan.</p>
        <p>About four miles before we arrived at <placeName><w rend="italics">Leeds</w></placeName>, in our way from <placeName><w
            rend="italics">Bradford</w></placeName>, we were suddenly presented with the grand and venerable
          ruins of <placeName><w rend="italics">Kirkstal-abbey</w></placeName>, full in view from the road: We stood some
          minutes looking with silent respect and reverence on the havock which had been made by
          time on this sacred edifice. How much soever we might condemn the mistaken notions of
          monkish piety, that induced the devotees to a lethargic supineness, and to forsake all the
          social duties of life in order to be good men; yet we secretly revered that holy zeal
          which inspirited them to exert every power in erecting structures, the magnitude and
          beauty of which might excite ideas worthy of the Deity to whom they</p>

          go to ruin, because they were once inhabited by a set of <roleName>christians</roleName> whose manner of

        <p><placeName>FURNESS FELLS</placeName>, and the adjacent parts here alluded to, are so peculiarly distinguished
          with picturesque beauty, that they deserve a more minute description. This country
          consists of a succession of mountains and vallies, formed and intermixed in all the
          possible variety of rural nature. Much of the vallies, and the bases of most of the hills,
          are covered with young wood, which at certain periods is cut down and charred for the use
          of the neighbouring furnaces. On this account the copses, which consist of various kinds
          of trees, constantly, in the summer, exhibit every pleasing colour of youthful vegetation.
          The main shoots, also, spring up so straight, and the collateral ones at such small angles
          with them, that they give an uncommon idea of vegetating vigour; and when they are seen
          rooted in the clefts of rocks, fancy will conceive them not unlike the streams of some
          fluid bursting forcibly from its prison. Among these copses are found several neat
          villages, houses, and spaces of cultivated land, which, with a number of brooks and
          rivers, tumbling and tinkling among them, constitute a scene of sylvan beauty exceedingly
          lively and singular. But what still enhances the whole is, the goodness of the highways,
          of which, in fine weather, it is not extravagant to say, in general, that they</p>
        <p>are</p>
        <pb n="300" facs="822.jp2"/>
        <p>ADDENDA. <seg type="pagenumber">283</seg></p>
        <p>are more like the walks of a gentleman's pleasure ground, than roads for ordinary
          occupation. This circumstance, though in part owing to the peculiar goodness of the
          materials, is, nevertheless, much indebted to the neatness and public spirit of the
          inhabitants,</p>
        <p>A laudable taste for adorning nature has led us from <hi rend="italics">ornamented
            gardens</hi> to <hi rend="italics">ornamented farms</hi>, and, being in the possession
          of good roads (an essential article for the display of rural beauty) there seems to be but
          one thing wanting to make this a truly <hi rend="italics">ornamented country</hi>. What I
          mean here is, <hi rend="italics">artificial objects</hi> raised on proper parts of the
          mountains and eminences, which at every turn are presented to us through some agreeable
          opening or other.</p>
        <p>Eminences are as naturally fit places for objects intended to attract the distant eye, as
          they are for enabling the eye to survey distant objects. Hence to decorate them with <hi
            rend="italics">columns, obelisks, temples</hi>, &amp;c. has the sanction of natural
          fitness. And if to this consideration we add that of the inherent beauty of the objects
          themselves, and remember, that there is nothing sets off the beauties of nature so much as
          elegant works of art,—justifying motives for these erections can never be wanting to any
          one who has a taste for rural beauty, and is willing to accomplish as much of it as is in
          his power. But this is not all. The practice is certainly patriotic. For such elegant
          ornaments will at least naturally contribute to diffuse a serenity and cheerfulness of
          mind into every beholder; and thence (if we may be pardoned the figure) like electrical
          conductors, they may be supposed to bring down a little of the happy placidity of better
          regions, to add to the natural quantity shooting about on the earth. As another motive it
          may be observed, that it is pleasing in any country to see the <roleName>inhabitants</roleName> so much at ease
          in mind and circumstances as to pay attention to these fanciful undertakings, and
          moreover, that as a man of sense appears the more so for seeming conscious of the
          importance of what he</p>
        <p>says,</p>
        <pb n="301" facs="823.jp2"/>
        <p><seg type="pagenumber">284</seg> ADDENDA.</p>
        <p>says, so every <roleName>traveller</roleName> will conceive the better of a people, who, sensible of the
          natural advantages of their country, are found disposed to make the best of them.</p>
        <p>How these objects should be formed or situated must for the most part be determined by
          circumstances under the eye of taste. One thing however seems worthy of particular notice
          in this place, which is, that erections of this fort would have the most grand and
          characteristic effect placed on eminences so as to have the sky for a back-ground. When
          this is the case, the hills they are raised upon should be bounded by agreeable lines,
          seen at a great distance, and much in sight of the principal roads.*</p>
        <p>The most simple of these erections are obelisks, and properly formed summer-houses, † But
          a series of columns constituting a temple, or supporting arches, pediments, &amp;c. would
          have by much the best effect, provided they were properly large, for the ordinary points
          of view. Through the openings of these columns, the sky would always give them a striking
          appearance; but in an evening, if the sun set behind them, no spectacle of the kind could
          be imagined more</p>
        <p>grand</p>
        <p>* If they be not intended also for a near inspection, they need not be of any expensive
          materials. Provided they be well formed in outline (and for the <w rend="italics"
            >design</w> of which artists of taste should always be applied to) common stone and
          mortar will do very well.</p>
        <p>† This kind of summer-house should either be octagonal, or at least have more than four
          stdes. And if either of these sorts of erections be not placed on very pointed hills, care
          should be taken to raise them (either by raising the earth on which they stand, or by
          giving them a high rustic base, &amp;c.) so that the sides of the hills will not prevent a
          complete sight of their elevation from the principal points of view.—Nothing can be worse
          managed than to see these objects as if rising beyond the top of the hill, or from the
          bottom of a fish-pond.</p>
        <p>Perhaps a summer-house standing on proper rustic arches (through which the sky might be
          seen) would, for the following reason, in some cases have a good effect.</p>

        <p>grand and attractive, or more accordant with the sublimity of the surrounding
          mountains.—Perforated doors and windows in the imitation of old gothic ruins, it is true,
          would yield part of this effect, but their gloomy and irregular appearance renders them in
          the case before us generally improper.</p>
        <p>Something of this kind (on the bolder eminences particularly) seems to be all the
          essential article that is wanting to perfect the rural beauties of this country; except,
          indeed, it may be thought, that a little more attention paid to the removal and planting
          of trees, would be of use for that end; and concerning which I beg leave to lengthen this
          article with a few observations.</p>
        <p>Trees are certainly the ornament and pride of vegetable nature. A bird despoiled of its
          plumage scarce seems more mutilated and ungainly than countries and inclofures destitute
          of trees. They have a good effect planted even (in their worst situation) any how in
          hedge-rows; but if they be lightly scattered with taste in proper parts of the enclosure
          itself, they become infinitely more pleasing. Hence, though nature has done wonders in the
          disposition of trees in some of her favourite haunts, yet still (if not in them) she may
          be improved upon in others, by the assistance of art. And let not the lips of sordidness
          object to the purport of this hint, that if put in practice it would ask some care and
          expence, and probably prevent the growth of what is more profitable to the <roleName>owner</roleName> and
          serviceable to man: For the <persName>God of nature</persName> is far from having fully proportioned the
          animals of the earth to its produce. And as he renders fruitless innumerable seeds of
          almost every vegetable and animal creature, so the application of a part of our cave, and
          a portion of the earth to its own ornament is, I am persuaded, so far from being culpable
          or improper, that (in humble imitation of the divine love of beauty and liberality) it
          seems as much to be required from the pious votary of nature as his admiration</p>
        <p>of</p>
        <pb n="303" facs="825.jp2"/>
        <p><seg type="pagenumber">286</seg> ADDENDA.</p>
        <p>of what comes immediately from its own efforts. In both cases <persName>God</persName> is alike honoured; and
          honour to God is certainly too nearly connected with religion to make it in any case an
          act of indifference. Do then, ye affluent and prosperous <roleName>land-holders</roleName>, pay some attention
          to this particular. Study the subject through the medium of books and pictures, and
          sometimes spare, and sometimes plant a tree for ornament's sake. And, if you think them
          reasonable ones, observe also the few following remarks, humbly offered to your
          consideration.—They shall be made as brief as possible.</p>
        <p>The greatest nicety and perfection in the art of planting; trees lies in the use of
          exotics, and an ingenious mixture of foliage, in order to decorate, for <hi rend="italics"
            >near inspection</hi>, the marginal views of a lawn, walk, &amp;c. But if ever a
          fondness for agriculture, built upon a love of simple nature and sober piety (of which
          there are too, <w rend="italics">too</w> few indications in our present manners) shall
          turn the general taste of the kingdom towards <hi rend="italics">ornamented farms</hi>,
          such an event cannot be supposed to be suddenly brought about. Hence, the precepts that
          relate to this elegant part of gardening will in this place be wholly unnecessary, and our
          attention must be confined to the management of the larger trees, which are already found
          in these regions.</p>
        <p>Scotch firs, though a favourite tree with many people, seem to require a good deal of
          judgment in their use; for they may be so planted as to injure a landscape more perhaps
          than they are generally seen to adorn it. In hanging-woods (with which this country
          abounds) they frequently appear to disadvantage <w rend="italics">however</w> disposed. A
          single tree in this case often looks like a blot, and a plantation like a daub; especially
          in winter, when the most is expected from their verdure. The reason of this seems to be
          the darkness of their colour, and the obviousness of their <w rend="italics">whole</w>
          form and out-line: From the first particular they always attract the eye more than any
          thing else, and, from the second, hurt the imagination</p>
        <p>with</p>
        <pb n="304" facs="826.jp2"/>
        <p>ADDENDA. <seg type="pagenumber">287</seg></p>
        <p>with presenting to it only a parcel of small <w rend="italics">limited</w>, streaks or
          patches, aukwardly <w rend="italics">inclined</w> to the horizon. When slightly and
          irregularly interspersed in woods of this kind they may now and then please from variety.
          But, in general, they come so forward to the eye, and, at a good distance in winter, so
          much resemble <hi rend="italics">yew, holly</hi>, and the like gloomy and barren-looking
          trees, that they do a real injury to the soft and pleasing tints, which result from the
          native stems, and which, from use, best accords with the idea of thriving woodlands.</p>
        <p>For these reasons Scotch firs look best when they are seen in large <w rend="italics"
            >horizontal</w> plantations, on low (or at least <w rend="italics">not</w> high) ground;
          when the front is only exposed to sight, (hence their depth backward imagined very great)
          and when the blue vapours of an extended horizon are seen over their tops. In this case
          they have a very grand effect, and form a fine dark contrast to the pale and distinct
          features of the over-looking hills.</p>
        <p>Those circular groups of trees called <w rend="italics">clumps</w> are oftener seen than
          worthy of praise. They appear to have the best effect (if they must be used) for near
          views, or when they are found in the middle of a <w rend="italics">level</w> open vale of
          fine lawn or meadow. But on the <w rend="italics">sides</w> of distant hills, or mountains
          (where they are seen <hi rend="italics">all round</hi>) their appearance is truly paltry.
          The more smooth and large these eminences are, the more improper this species of ornament
          becomes; and in short, I apprehend, the features of a lady's face would scarce be more
          injured by the mark of her thimble, than the features of several hills would be by these
          unnatural circles.—At the same time however that we censure this mode of decorating
          mountains, it may be proper to observe, that if they be wholly covered with wood, or
          lightly interspersed with single trees, &amp;c. the effect will be natural and
          pleasing.</p>
        <p>But the most absurd decoration of these eminences in vogue</p>
        <p>is</p>
        <pb n="305" facs="827.jp2"/>
        <p><seg type="pagenumber">288</seg> ADDENDA.</p>
        <p>is a few trees placed on their top, so that the whole boles of the foremost ranks may be
          seen down to their very roots. Trees we know are chiefly the produce of the lower parts of
          the earth's surface, and to see the roots of some above the heads of others, as it were,
          tire above tire, is not natural and therefore not beautiful.—Houses, which are the work of
          art, seldom look well in this form. In short, whatever be the circumstances of the base of
          a fine mountain as to wood, its top should either be wholly naked, or ornamented with one
          of those artificial erections spoken of above.</p>
        <p>These observations will also hold good with respect to little abrupt prominences, or
          swells, in ornamented grounds; which (if they must be tampered with) would receive more
          improvement from being encircled with an assortment of shrubs, over whose tops the crowns
          of the hills (either plain or terminated with some agreeable erection of stone) might be
          fairly seen, than from a few large trees, planted, as we often find, on their summits. For
          where these swells are pretty frequent (as they mostly are in uneven countries) art is
          better applied in lowering them, as it were <hi rend="italics">to the eye</hi>, than in
          giving them <w rend="italics">real</w> additional height.</p>
        <p>As to avenues of tall trees, they have certainly a noble effect for a private walk, or
          the first part of an approach to a <roleName>gentleman</roleName>'s seat. But seen from distant eminences, they
          often betray a good deal of the formality of a common sence.</p>
        <p>To close the subject with a maxim or two more. Keep all large trees at a good distance
          from every neat-looking house.* Always consider extensive unevenly-bounded forests to
          have</p>
        <p>an</p>
        <p>* Respecting <w rend="italics">houses</w>, I would just observe, by the bye, that to any
          person, save to a native inured to them, buildings of <w rend="italics">blue-rag</w>
          without mortar have a very mean and depressing look, and that, if it fall conveniently
          within reach, the common rough-cast of limestone countries has the most neat and chearful
          appearance of any outside finish, of an easy expence and of easy management.</p>

        <p>an infinitely better effect in a landscape, than an equal quantity of trees dispersed
          over it in crowded formally-enclosed patches. And, above all things, never forget the
          superlative beauty which (for a near view) may be given to a park, farm, or cultivated
          country, by single trees, lightly and irregularly placed out of the hedge-rows.</p>
        <p>The bounds of this article will not admit of more than a few leading remarks on this
          subject; but I fancy if the above hints were observed, they would be sufficient, under the
          influence of taste, for the intended purpose. And though they are thrown out more
          particularly with a view to one part of the country included in this tour, yet it is all
          so much alike in several respects, that they might be attended to with the same advantage
          in every other. And were these ideas verified, I flatter myself this northern district
          would be worthy of being termed the <placeName>British Arcadia</placeName>, and exhibit nearly to the utmost
          pitch of the <roleName>poets</roleName> fancy,</p>

        <p>good order (for, as observed before, their beauty is essential to rural beauty.*)
          Preserve your native modesty, and never let envy mar your civility. When you prune a fence
          joining to a public road, put the branches where they can be no annoyance, † and then, as
          you are already exemplary in many moral virtues, you will set a pattern of rural decency
          worthy of the imitation of several politer parts of the kingdom.</p>
        <p>* The great advantage that any town receives in appearance, merely from the letters on
          the various <w rend="italics">signs</w>, &amp;c. being elegantly done, is very evident.
          And were the <w rend="italics">finger-posts</w> on the roads executed with proper taste,
          they might be made as ornamental as they are useful; and hence yield due credit to the
          public-spirit of the townships to which they belong, instead of being thought (as they
          often are at present) lamentable indications of their ignorance and poverty.</p>
        <p>† It may also be here proper to remind the <roleName>husbandmen</roleName> and <roleName>farmers</roleName> of another slovenly
          practice they are frequently guilty of in most countries; I mean the custom of throwing
            <hi rend="italics">stones, weeds</hi>, and other kinds of rubbish, from their fields,
          upon the face of the roads, with no more regard to the seemliness of its appearance than
          to the moral honesty of the deed. If they cannot comprehend that they have no more right
          to make use of the roads for this purpose than a <roleName>neighbour</roleName>'s field, and, that, though
          generally connived at, the practice is wrong, the surveyors would do very well to teach
          them this decent piece of knowledge by the proper severities of the law.</p>

        <p>ARTICLE X.</p>
        <p>SOME REMARKS</p>
        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">respecting the provincial words, &amp;c. used by the common people
            in the limits of this tour.</hi></p>
        <p>THE language of any people, however refined it may become in time, has undoubtedly arisen
          from some rude original, and he, therefore, who wishes thoroughly to understand its genius
          and primary elements, must, if possible, make himself acquainted with its formation in its
          earliest stages. Now this knowledge is often best acquired from the mouths of the vulgar,
          who, living far removed from refinement, have probably retained a dialect nearly the same
          with that which resulted from the last casual admixture it underwent among their rustic
          ancestors; and which in <placeName><w rend="italics">England</w></placeName> 
          was the union of the <trait type="ethnicity"><label><hi
              rend="italics">Saxon</hi></label>
          </trait> with the ancient <trait type="ethnicity">
            <label><hi rend="italics">British</hi></label>
          </trait>. On this account
          the critic in our language would at present receive the best information concerning its
          principles and character, by studying the provincial dialects of the times in some of the
          most retired districts. And as they are now suffering a daily change from the rapid
          progress made of late in every branch of politeness, it is to be wished, that for this end
          our <roleName>provincial historians</roleName> had carefully attended to and preserved the peculiar terms and
          phrases of the vulgar dialects, current in their respective divisions.* Particularly this
          was to be wished</p>
        <p>of</p>
        <p>* It is also to be wished (and in this wish I have the concurrence of several judicious
          friends) that the ingenious in these parts would immediately set about making collections
          of the <hi rend="italics">oldest words</hi> and <hi rend="italics">peculiar phrases</hi>
          used by their common neighbours, and preserve them in case some learned and
          properly-qualified person should hereafter undertake to give us a complete dictionary of
          the <placeName><w rend="italics">Westmorland</w></placeName> and <placeName><w rend="italics">Cumberland</w></placeName> dialects, to
          whom they might be of the greatest service. Of such a work the list of words which has
          lately appeared in the <hi rend="italics">Tour to the Caves</hi>, might be a
          beginning.</p>

        <p>of the counties of <placeName><w rend="italics">Westmorland</w></placeName> and <placeName><w rend="italics"
          >Cumberland</w></placeName>, where the common speech at this day (besides many obsolete words used by
          our elder <roleName>poets</roleName>, from <persName><w rend="italics">Chaucer</w></persName> down to <persName><w rend="italics">Spencer</w></persName>,
          &amp;c.) contains several unnoticed roots and elements of derivation. These dialects are
          much different in many words from the <hi rend="italics">broad <placeName>Lancashire</placeName></hi>: And were
          they collected and digested in some such manner as the specimens of an <hi rend="italics"
            >English-British Dictionary</hi> given us by the ingenious and learned <roleName>author</roleName> of the <hi
            rend="italics">History of Manchester</hi>, and his completed, I am satisfied these
          works, with the assistance of the <hi rend="italics"><trait type="ethnicity">
            
            <label>Welch</label>
          </trait>, <trait type="ethnicity">

              <label>Gothic</label>
            </trait> and <trait type="ethnicity">
              
              <label>Teutonic</label>
            </trait> languages, would throw an
          unexpected light on the bases, structure, and analogies of the <trait type="ethnicity">
            
            <label>English</label>
          </trait> tongue.</p>
        <p>As a slight specimen of this, I will put down the derivation of a few words, of which we
          find little in our dictionaries, or little satisfactory. Many more might be given from a
          cursory recollection, but we must not forget the chief intent of this volume, and that <hi
            rend="italics"><persName>Swift</persName>'s discourse on the antiquity of the <trait type="ethnicity">
              
              <label>English</label>
            </trait> tongue</hi> is perhaps
          in more hands than may know the due limits of its ridicule. And should these etymologies
          appear to some more whimsical than just, it should be re-</p>
        <p>membered</p>
        <p>There are also in these parts (as in every other part alike retired) several stories of
          apparitions, witches, fairies, &amp;c.—several traditionary tales of strange
          occurrences,—and many compositions of <roleName>rural bards</roleName>, under the titles of <hi rend="italics"
            >speech plays, masking songs</hi>, &amp;c. which if collected as much as possible in
          their provincial dress, and preserved in some public library, before they are likely to be
          lost in the more engaging amusements of these improving times, might be of considerable
          use to the future grammarian, <roleName>historian</roleName>, or <roleName>investigator of the progress of society and
            manners</roleName>. The <roleName>poet</roleName> too, might from these traditionary narratives, and superstitious ideas,
          gain more materials for some provinces of his fanciful art, than from the richest
          invention: For it is not easy to suppose he can form for himself as striking a combination
          of events, and association of ideas, as may have been furnished by the accidents of time,
          and the fruitfulness of superstition; and on the account of which <w rend="italics"
            >strikingness</w> these fire-side tales have obtained so long and general a tradition as
          many of them can boast—But I am content with barely throwing out a hint, which if thought
          worth notice will not need any farther enlargement.</p>
        <pb n="316" facs="838.jp2"/>
        <p>ADDENDA. <seg type="pagenumber">299</seg></p>
        <p>membered that they appeal to the only <w rend="italics">kind</w> of evidence of which
          they are capable; that they cannot <w rend="italics">all</w> yield the <w rend="italics"
            >same</w> degree of conviction, and that this sort of inquiry is a matter of <w
            rend="italics">self-persuasion</w> from a view of circumstances, and not of <hi
            rend="italics">demonstrative proof</hi> from undeniable principles.</p>
        <p><w rend="italics">Dess</w>, in this vulgar dialect, is <hi rend="italics">to put in
            order</hi>. Hence a <w rend="italics">writing-desk</w>, in which are contained little
          cells, and other conveniences of arrangement, has its name. <w rend="italics">Distaff</w>
          is consequently properly <w rend="italics">dess-staff</w>, or a staff or rod on which the
          flax is fitly disposed for spinning. It is also probable that from this idea we have the
          word dress, both as applied to the person and things, as dressing of victuals, &amp;c.</p>
        <p>The endeavour of children to get upon any thing, is in. this country termed <hi
            rend="italics">to clever</hi>. Hence the phrase of a clever fellow primarily means, one
          who is capable of surmounting any thing he undertakes.</p>
        <p><w rend="italics">Kink</w>, is to be thrown into the convulsions which we observe in the
          highest degree of coughing or laughter. Hence the cough in children which always put on
          this strained appearance is called the <w rend="italics">Kink-cough</w>. From an ignorance
          of this etymology, though with some reference to the found, we find the word wrote <w
            rend="italics">chin</w>, or <w rend="italics">king-cough</w>. Also the <w rend="italics"
            >loops</w> which twisted threads (or hairs for fishing-lines) are apt to run into are
          sometimes called <w rend="italics">kinks</w>. From which it appears in both cases, that an
          idea of <w rend="italics">convulsion</w> is implied in the term <w rend="italics"
          >kink</w>.</p>
        <p><w rend="italics">Wee</w>, in <placeName><w rend="italics">Cumberland</w></placeName>, signifies <w
            rend="italics">little</w>. Hence <w rend="italics">wevel</w> (the infect in corn) is
          formed of <w rend="italics">wee</w> and <w rend="italics">evil</w>, and means, the <hi
            rend="italics">little evil</hi>. <w rend="italics">Wee</w> combined with <w
            rend="italics">edge</w> makes <w rend="italics">wedge</w>, a well-known instrument with
          a <w rend="italics">small</w> or <w rend="italics">thin</w> edge.</p>
        <p><w rend="italics">Hee</w>, is the term for <w rend="italics">high</w>. Hence <w
            rend="italics">hedge</w> is from <w rend="italics">hee-hedge</w>, or <w rend="italics"
            >high-edge</w>. At first this fence would be made of earth and stones, and afterwards
          quick fences serving the same purpose would have the same name.</p>

            rend="italics">slay</w> and <w rend="italics">edge</w>. It is not so clear that <w
            rend="italics">sedge</w> is from <w rend="italics">sea-edge</w>, but the verb to <w
            rend="italics">slay</w>, comes plainly from a like idea of <w rend="italics"
            >swinging</w> the arm.</p>
        <p><w rend="italics">Do</w>, in these parts is <w rend="italics">dee</w> or <w
            rend="italics">due</w>. Hence <w rend="italics">Devil</w> is formed of <w rend="italics"
            >dee-evil</w>. In like manner, the true original meaning of <w rend="italics">snivel</w>
          and <w rend="italics">drivel</w> (from whence we have the opprobrious terms of <w
            rend="italics">sniveler</w> and <w rend="italics">driveler</w>) may be easily
          gained.</p>
        <p>When cabbins served for houses, what they put over the entrance to keep out the weather,
          was called <hi rend="italics">due o'er</hi>, that is, the thing to <w rend="italics"
            >do-over</w>. Hence the origin of the word <w rend="italics">door</w>, both as an
          opening and as an instrument.</p>
        <p><w rend="italics">Heel</w>, is a little gate made of rails (generally pointed and
          upright) for several domestic purposes. Whence we have the term <w rend="italics">hack</w>
          for an implement used in digging. The long pointed feathers on a cock's neck are also on
          this account called <w rend="italics">hackles</w>. Hence the name of hackle for the
          well-known instrument for dressing flax, and hence also the etymology of the word <w
            rend="italics">icicle</w>, which is evidently <w rend="italics">ice-hackle</w>, or a
          long pointed piece of ice, and which conveys a very characteristic idea.</p>
        <p><w rend="italics">Arr</w> (whence <w rend="italics">scarr</w>) signifies <hi
            rend="italics">a mark</hi>, made by the action of something upon another. Hence the
          common term <w rend="italics">arr-edge</w>, means the edge of any thing that is liable to
          hurt or <w rend="italics">arr</w>. But as a final syllable the term is of the most
          striking use in explaining words.—<roleName><w rend="italics">Wizard</w></roleName> hence evidently means one
            <w rend="italics">marked</w> with <w rend="italics">wisdom</w>; <w rend="italics"
            >Godard</w>, with <w rend="italics">goodness</w>; <w rend="italics">haggard</w> with the
          shrivelled, &amp;c. look of a <w rend="italics">hag</w>; <w rend="italics">drunkard</w>,
          with <w rend="italics">drink</w>; <w rend="italics">sluggard</w> with <w rend="italics"
            >sloth</w>; <w rend="italics">mustard</w>, with <w rend="italics">must</w>; <w

        <p><w rend="italics">Kelter</w>, or <w rend="italics">skelter</w> (a word almost forgot)
          means <w rend="italics">order</w> as to arrangement, or <w rend="italics">condition</w> as
          to body. Hence the phrase of people running <hi rend="italics">helter skelter</hi> means
          running in despite of all order; <w rend="italics">helter</w> order meaning <w

        </trait> word for <w
            rend="italics">straw</w>, though now out of use, and is here the present vulgar
          pronunciation of <w rend="italics">home</w>. From this circumstance it is not improbable
          but that straw, which once constituted the most general bed, might give the name to the
          place of domestic repose, by the same figure that has denominated our ordinary repasts <w
            rend="italics">meals</w>, from the <w rend="italics">meal</w> that was heretofore the
          general food, and as <w rend="italics">boarding</w> and <w rend="italics">tabling</w> mean
          the gratuity of so much per week for victuals eat on <w rend="italics">boards</w> and <w
            rend="italics">tables</w>, &amp;c.—Hence it is easy to see <w rend="italics">hamlet</w>
          means a <w rend="italics">lot</w> or parcel of <w rend="italics">homes</w>; and hence is
          had perhaps the term <w rend="italics">ham</w> for the wooden collar now put on the neck
          of a cart-horse, from its connexion with a <w rend="italics">boss</w>, or <w

          made of <w rend="italics">straw</w>, called a <w rend="italics">barriham</w>.</p>
        <p><w rend="italics">Stee</w>, is the vulgar name here for <w rend="italics">ladder</w>, and
            <w rend="italics">steel</w> for <w rend="italics">style</w>. Hence the idea of something
          high or upright, which is contained in these words <w rend="italics">steep</w>, <w

        <p><w rend="italics">Cap</w>, or <w rend="italics">Cob</w>, means <hi rend="italics">head,
            master, top</hi>, &amp;c. Hence the common word <w rend="italics">cobby</w> means <hi

            rend="italics">job-nut</w>) means a thrift for mastery between the contending nuts.</p>
        <p><w rend="italics">Atter</w>, it is well known signifies blood or gore, and hence we have
          a very characteristic meaning in the name of <w rend="italics">atter-cob</w> given in

        <p><w rend="italics">Scale</w>, means to <w rend="italics">spread</w> or <hi rend="italics"

        </lg>
        <p>Thus much respecting the <w rend="italics">meaning of words</w>; what follows is a
          concluding remark with regard to <w rend="italics">sound</w>.</p>
        <p>One would think there is so great a likeness in the form of these originally <trait type="ethnicity">
          
          <label><hi rend="italics">Saxon</hi></label>
        </trait> or <trait type="ethnicity">
          <desc><hi rend="italics">British</hi></desc>
        </trait> words, <hi rend="italics"
            >wound, sound, hound, ground, pound</hi>, &amp;c. that there could be no variation in
          the form of pronouncing them, wherever they were all used. Yet, the word <w rend="italics"
            >wound</w> is of late become an exception among the politer part of the world, who
          pronounce it <w rend="italics">woond</w>, or in such a manner as it will not rhyme with
          any of the other</p>
        <p>words.</p>

        <p>ADDENDA. <seg type="pagenumber">303</seg></p>
        <p>words. This mode of speaking the word under consideration is precisely the <hi
            rend="italics">vulgar one</hi> used in some of these northern parts where they call <hi
            rend="italics">sound, soond—hound, hoond—pound, poond— ground, groond</hi>, &amp;c. in
          which pronunciation, though we cannot think there is much beauty, there is undoubtedly a
          becoming uniformity worthy of imitation.</p>
        <p>It is not easy to see on what account this word <w rend="italics">wound</w> was singled
          out for the favourite alteration, but it is easy to see that its new sound will injure the
          rhymes of many of our best <roleName>poets</roleName>, particularly <persName><w rend="italics">Pope</w></persName>, who always
          considers <w rend="italics">wound</w> as rhyming with any of the other words
          above-mentioned. This hint may perhaps give a south-country person, a different idea than
          he might have entertained of the propriety of the innovation in question: For certainly
          nothing ought to be adopted into a language which is <w rend="italics">unnecessarily</w>
          contrary to its analogy and fundamental laws.</p>

        <p>weather—the clay seems dried to a brick; and how the poor corn can push its roots through
          such a substance is above my comprehension! The power of vegetable life, I know, is
          prodigious, as I have known the side of a house damaged by the root of a tree; and the
          efforts which vegetables will make for a subsistence is almost equal to the sagacity of
          animals. A striking instance of this I saw in a wood near the beautiful seat of <persName><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir John
          Dashwood</hi></persName>, at <placeName><w rend="smallcaps">West-Wycombe</w></placeName>. Here the road was cut so deep, that the roots of the trees
          stuck through the overhanging soil into the air on each side of the road. Trees left in
          such distressing circumstances had need of every effort: accordingly, the roots had shot
          out long fibres to catch the soil below, and numbers had been successful. This I call the
          instinct of plants; and the manner in which <w rend="italics">tendrils</w> will lean towards a support—the
          manner in which <w rend="smallcaps">flowers</w> turn themselves towards the sun, and shut themselves from the
          rain—the manner in which <w rend="smallcaps">branches</w> shoot towards the open side of a wood, and many other
          circumstances, prove indisputably that there is an instint in vegetables.</p>

        <p>But to return—After crossinng the watery vale of <placeName><w rend="smallcaps">Uxbridge</w></placeName>, we enter a fine diversity of
          country; hill and dale, wood and water alternately solicit with novelty. The wood-topped
          hills relieve the vallies; and high-dressed pleasure-grounds contrast with
          well-cultivated farms. In this fine range of hills (running from <placeName><w rend="smallcaps">Maidenhead-Thicket</w></placeName> through the long county of <w rend="smallcaps">Bucks</w>) are situated many
          elegant seats. We passed one belonging to the <persName><hi rend="smallcaps">Duke of Portland</hi></persName>, whose park encloses
          several of those hills, all clothed with wood in a stile worthy the celebrated <w rend="smallcaps">Brown</w>. The
          mottled deer and large cattle demonstrate the goodness of the soil, as well as the smooth
          verdure of the vallies. My black mirror presented me with many beautiful landscapes in
          this park, that a <persName><w rend="smallcaps">Claude</w></persName> might not have disdained to copy.</p>
        <p><placeName><w rend="smallcaps">West-Wycombe</w></placeName>, the tasteful seat of <persName><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir John Dashwood</hi></persName>, next attracted our attention.
          Nature has done much here, and art more; but, alas! the pleasure of seeing such
          luxurious scenes is much chastised by the neglect we see on all sides and in all parts</p>

        <p>of this elegant retreat. Neither art nor nature will remain perfect without the pruning
          hand of taste and industry: yet is the taste of the founder of this delicious place still
          evident, even in its tendency to ruin. The half-hid facade on the hill—the clumps on its
          sides—its lawns speckled with sheep—the luxurious feathering of the trees, clustering in
          some places into dark recesses, in others scattered over the smooth slopes, and bellying
          into the serpentine elegancies of <w rend="smallcaps">Hogarth</w>'s line of beauty—these beauties are not yet
          defaced, nor can they be forgot while the prints of this sweet place shall exist!</p>
        <p>Like the devices we read of in <persName><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir William Chambers</hi></persName>'s Oriental Gardening, we experience
          light and shade in making our way into and out of woods of lime-trees, till we arrive in
          one so thick, dark, and long, that the mind is apt to picture the spreading arms of trees
          into the arms and legs of <roleName>desperate assassins</roleName> or <roleName>lurking banditti</roleName>!—when all at once the
          scene opens into a wide plain, too extended to see it terminate but</p>

        <p>with the sky. This beheld from the top of <placeName><w rend="smallcaps">Stoken-Church-Hill</w></placeName> (the verge of that range
          just mentioned) fills the mind like the ocean seen from a promontory!</p>
        <p>Now the scene changes from the <w rend="smallcaps">Sylvan</w> to the rich domain of <w rend="smallcaps">Ceres</w>. The land is but a thin
          mantle, covering a bed of chalk, but finely pulverized by the hand of industry. After
          some time it changes to a clay, and near <placeName>Oxford</placeName> the clay hardens into a thin, laminated,
          crumbly stone, inclosing many marine productions, particularly the <w rend="italics">Nautilus</w>, and <hi rend="italics">Cornu
          Ammonis</hi>, Attention to these is now drawn off by the domes and spires of <placeName><w rend="smallcaps">Oxford</w></placeName>. The
          turrets multiply into a coraline wood, and, mixing with the tall trees of the gardens,
          form a view totally unlike any town in the three kingdoms.</p>

        <p>I CANNOT pass through Oxford without a few remarks upon the progress of the Arts in this
          antient University. The <w rend="smallcaps">Sculpture</w> of the older Colleges exhibits the gross taste of our
          ancestors in both a clumsy and a ludicrous light. The statues are misshapen—the altos
          coarse and ill-defined—and the grimaces ludicrous, obscene, and void of fancy! About the
          reign of <persName>the First James</persName>, a glimpse had been obtained of <trait type="ethnicity">
            
            <label>Grecian</label>
          </trait> Architecture, and it is
          curious to observe how it began to interweave itself with the taste of that period, as
          many of the tall gate-ways of the Colleges prove; where, in imitation of what had been
          seen at <placeName>Rome</placeName>, the Doric sustains the bottom story, then follows the Ionic, next the
          Corinthian, and last or upper-most the Composite; and yet these are interlarded with
          Gothic or more rude ornaments, and make a motley medley of all kinds of architecture,
          particularly at Christ Church,</p>
        <p><seg type="pagesignature">B 4</seg> where</p>
        <pb n="341" facs="863.jp2"/>
        <p><seg type="pagenumber">8</seg> OBSERVATIONS MADE IN A TOUR</p>
        <p>where the venerable and the splendid are contrasted in the antique facade and the new
          square called <placeName>Peckwater</placeName>, At last, however, the <trait type="ethnicity">
            
            <label>Grecian</label>
          </trait> has prevailed, and many most
          elegant specimens are to be seen in <placeName>Oxford</placeName>. This must not be considered as universal.
          Many judicious conformities are made, and are now making, to the genius of the Gothic
          buildings in their repairs or additions; some of these (of artificial stone) exceed the
          laboured originals.</p>
        <p><w rend="smallcaps">Painting</w> has also stept forward by gradations very similar. The stiff broad-shouldered
          patriots of the fifteenth century—the legendary incidents that impudently assumed the name
          of History in that period, have gradually given way to good sense and nature; and instead
          of distorted figures covered with glaring colours in their windows, we see a <w rend="smallcaps">Nativity</w> by
          <persName><w rend="smallcaps">Jervais</w></persName> equal (perhaps superior in effect) to any on canvas.</p>
        <p><w rend="smallcaps">Music</w> has still made further strides towards perfection. Vulgar annual songs were once
          considered as almost a part of the institution. <persName><w rend="smallcaps">Handel</w></persName>'s portrait is now to be seen</p>
        <p>among</p>
        <pb n="342" facs="864.jp2"/>

        <p>among the sages of the <w rend="smallcaps">Bodleian</w> repository, and his music is enjoyed, well understood,
          and even performed by thousands of the University! Can any thing exhibit the improved
          taste in that divine science so justly, as the degree just given to the modest <persName><w rend="smallcaps">Haydn</w></persName> by
          the University?—this musical <persName><w rend="smallcaps">Shakespeare</w></persName>, this musical Drawcansir, who can equal the
          strains of a Cherub, and enchant in all the gradations between those and a ballad—a genius
          whose versatility comprehends all the powers of harmony! and all the energy, pathos, and
          passion of melody!—who can stun with thunder, or warble with a bird!—For the honour of the
          University be it known, that this honour wras conferred without form of examination, and
          indeed such transcendent merit deserved the liberal compliment in the way it was
          conferred.</p>
        <p><w rend="smallcaps">Would</w> to God I could say as much for the science I love!—Must <w rend="smallcaps">Astronomy</w>, which
          recognizes the whole universe, be more limited in the liberality of its Professors than
          the sensual Arts? How much do I pity the smallest retainer to that first of human
          attainments who can be influenced by colle-</p>

        <p>giate pride, or the dark seclusions of a <roleName>Monk</roleName>! No more—I scorn to be a second time
          denied the sight of an <w rend="smallcaps">Observatory</w> by excuses, let them be ever so plausible. This seems
          much of a piece with that sordid spirit which has so long kept the valuable Observations
          of <persName>Dr. <w rend="smallcaps">Bradley</w></persName> from public inspection, and thereby deprived Astronomy, Geography, and
          Navigation of such helps as, with the later Observations, would have rendered those
          sciences perfect.</p>
        <p><w rend="smallcaps">Politeness</w>, however, is not wanting at <placeName>Oxford</placeName> in general. A cluster of acquaintances
          accompanied me to see every thing rare or extraordinary, and there was much to see! Much
          indeed I had seen before, but the inquisitive can never exhaust variety in this City.</p>
        <p><hi rend="smallcaps"><persName>Christ</persName> bearing his cross</hi> (said to be by <persName> <w rend="smallcaps">Guido</w></persName>), in Magdalen College, is an expressive
          figure, characteristic of his divinity and passion, stooping under a bodily and mental
          burthen, his depressed countenance still more depressed by the bloody sweat: pity, indeed,
          is not much excited by the crown of thorns,</p>
        <p>it</p>

        <p>it seems to fit the head so very well. The other victims and the guards are at such a
          distance, that <persName>Christ</persName> might have escaped, if it had not been necessary to universal
          salvation that he should be crucified.</p>
        <p><hi rend="smallcaps"><persName>Christ</persName> reproving the woman</hi>, by <w rend="smallcaps">Mengs</w>, is a tolerable specimen of the works of that
          Artist, though much inferior to many of his in <placeName>Rome</placeName>.</p>
        <p><w rend="smallcaps">The</w> two candlesticks of eight feet high (the parts dug out of the ruins of <persName><w rend="smallcaps">Adrian</w></persName>'s Villa
          near Tivoli) in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Radcliffe Library</hi>, are fine specimens of antient art, and almost equal

          geometric stairs, whose height destroys the relish for contemplating their contrivance and
          ingenuity,—The Bell has no machinery left by which it could be raised; the Clapper is
          therefore drawn by cords against the Bell when tolled, instead of the Bell being
          influenced against the Clapper, as usual. Is it not rather extraordinary that this easy
          mode of ringing a Bell should only be adopted in this instance?</p>

        <p>FROM <placeName>Oxford</placeName> to <placeName>Blenheim</placeName> the country opens into rich but not picturesque beauty; the soil
          a thin clay—the stones flat and crumbly. <placeName><w rend="smallcaps">Blenheim</w></placeName> is certainly a magnificent seat at a
          distance, viewed <hi rend="italics">en gros</hi>; we become undeceived in the approach; the incongruous parts
          jumble into a vast but not a pleasant whole. The heavy architect had a mind to display all
          his powers; but like a mechanic belumbered by a multitude of tools, he has taken up the
          chissel where he should have used the hammer, and thrown together a number of parts,
          without what painters would call <w rend="italics">keeping</w>, or <roleName>musicians</roleName> <w rend="italics">modulation</w>. The parts do certainly
          not assimilate. What business have <w rend="smallcaps">Italian</w> balconies on the top of an <trait type="ethnicity">

          that the family owes the possession of <placeName>Blenheim</placeName>, is rather an extraordinary intimation,

        <p>TALK-ON-THE-HILL displays the whole <placeName><hi rend="smallcaps">County of Chester</hi></placeName> like a flat wood beneath our
          feet. The <placeName>Lancashire Mountains</placeName> on the right, and those of <placeName>Wales</placeName> on the left, bound the
          plain. This view is more extensive than beautiful; neither town, village, nor house,
          <w rend="smallcaps">breaks</w> the uniformity of this scene: indeed the Counties of <placeName>Chester</placeName> and <placeName>Lancaster</placeName> seem
          the last part of <placeName>Britain</placeName> that "rose out of the azure main;" and accordingly the soil in both
          is but a thin sward spread over a bed of sea-sand. We are indebted to this sward, however,
          and the superabundant rain that keeps it always moist, for the finest cheese in the
          world. Why then should we repine at the moist atmosphere that covers our Island? Were
          we in the Moon, our telescopes would shew us that this Island is more green than any spot
          on the face of the earth. This verdure we</p>

        <p>owe to rain; in consequence, our horses, cattle, sheep (nay, I am proud to say the Human
          Animal), exceed those of any other country. Indeed these two Counties seem to have more
          than their share of this useful element; for the Mountains which separate them from
          Yorkshire stop the western clouds from the <placeName>Atlantic Ocean</placeName>, and by the rain-gauge it is
          found that at least one-third more rain falls in <placeName>Lancashire</placeName> than <placeName>Yorkshir></placeName> (surface for
          surface), upon an average made from many years observations. The breed of horned cattle of
          <placeName>Cheshire</placeName>, however, is much inferior to that of <placeName>Lancashire</placeName>, though it produces better
          cheese. A cow at best is but an unwieldy and clumsy animal; but in <placeName>Lancashire</placeName> she has
          wide serpentine horns, a belly as light as a horse, beautifully spotted, or uniformly
          streaked from the back-bone on each side: in short, a Lancashire cow may really be called
          a beautiful animal.</p>

          surface, of unknown extent, that, excepting some earthy and other heterogeneous matter
          mixed with it, may be considered as a bed of real marine (or table) salt. Water issuing
          through this bed dissolves the salts, and becomes a brine of great strength, is drawn up
          to the surface, and after evaporation becomes the fine crystalline basker-salt of the
          table. The rock itself is also a great commercial object, being sent to Liverpool in huge
          blocks, where it serves as ballast to returning ships, instead of stone; and as it
          dissolves in sea-water, it forms a brine capable of yielding twice the quantity of salt
          the water would without it—hence becoming saleable in every sea-port in Europe.</p>
        <p><w rend="smallcaps">Coals</w> are also used as ballast from <placeName>Liverpool</placeName>. These two articles for back carriage give
          this port a decided superiority over all others in the kingdom. Besides, its imports being

        law-suits at last produced a broad pavement, which would suffer two carriages to pass each
          other; and this was thought the ultimate perfection that a country without gravel could go
          to; and the narrow pavement became covered with grass. In this state the Roads have
          continued many years, to the great profit of the coach-maker, and the cure of indigestion:
          but now both the broad and narrow pavements are pulling up, the pebbles breaking into
          small pieces, and their interstices filling up with sand. So far as this method has

          is filled, a sluice is drawn, which fills the first bucket with water from the reservoir,
          which by its weight descends, and hoists up the bucket of coals or lime-stone to the
          surface, and then oversets, emptying its water into the canal below. Lime-stone (so much
          wanted in Lancashire) is brought from Wales up the Canal, and thus hoisted upon high
          ground, and burnt there in numerous kilns into lime, with a facility that looks like

        <p>IN my last endeavoured to give you some idea of the striking appearance of this ancient
          Borough, when seen about a mile off, on the <placeName>London</placeName> road. The huge square Tower of the
          Castle is picturesquely broken by the intervention of smaller ones; the fine Tower of
          the Church also seems part of the assemblage, and both these being on the summit of an
          high hill, with the town falling in an ealy slope down the sides of it, make a group, that
          impresses the idea of a more stately town, than we find it. Every thing, however, both
          without and within doors, is neat and clean to a proverb. Not that it is so because there
          is nothing to dirty it—considerabie bustle is occasioned by an extensive <placeName>West-India</placeName> Trade,
          which employs fifty sail of ships, many of 300 tons burthen, which can float close to the
          side of the town. An</p>

        <p><w rend="smallcaps">The</w> imports here are principally Rum and Cotton; and the exports, Provisions and Mahogany
          Furniture; in the taste and elegance of the latter they are scarcely equalled in the
          Capital. Ship-building also employs a great number of hands, and stouter ships are said to
          be built here than in any other port in the kingdom. Cotton-mills, Cotton-weaving,
          Bleaching and Stamping, also employ many in the town and neighbourhood; as well as
          spinning and weaving Sailcloth.—Hence much of the rough stone buildings have made room for elegant houses of beautiful hewn stone: beautiful I say,
          because it is variegated with streaks of ferruginous earth, so as to represent landscapes,
          foliage, &amp;c. that give the houses a very singular appearance. Of this stone was lately
          built an handsome Town-hall; under which and its massy portico the market-people find
          good shelter; the strength of the pillars of this portico may perhaps be excused, from
          their having a large temple-like turret to support,</p>

          County.—It consists of five large and equal arches, over which the road is a straight line,
          so the ascent is at each end only; the arches are a flat oval; hence it has much the
          appearance of the light Cycloidal Bridge over the <placeName>Arno</placeName> in <placeName>Florence</placeName>. The pressure on the
          buttress of the arches is judiciously taken off (or rather brought to balance the rest) by
          large perforations over each pier, like those in the broken bridge of the Via Sacra at
          <placeName>Rome</placeName>.—These perforations have their entrance decorated with a pediment supported by two
          Doric pillars;—and the ballustrade is of turned stone. In short, I think this the most beautiful bridge, for its size, of any in <placeName>England</placeName>.</p>

          for it is certainly more confident with the wisdom and humanity of a State to prevent
          rather than punish crimes. But, indeed, it is a satire upon either our laws or the
          morality of our times, that such novel regulations are necessary. These additions will

        <p><w rend="smallcaps">The</w> Gateway of this antient structure consists of two octogonal Towers of vast size,
          which the Gate itself and the Curtain over it unites, with the usual opening for a

          turret, is a square recess called <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName>John of Ghaunt</persName>'s Chair</hi>. From this alarming height the
          prospect is diversified beyond description! The great bay or inlet called Lancaster
          Sands seems spread out before us like an immense lake, setting the Alpine mountains north
          of it at a proper distance for exciting wonder in those who have been used to a flat
          country. Blackcoomb rises from the sea, on the left, with round majesty; and the flat
          well-cultivated Peninsula of <placeName>Furness</placeName> makes a good foreground to it. Further to the left
          appears <placeName>Peele Castle</placeName>, sticking out of the sea like a man's nose. Turning to the

          and broken masses, very like the <placeName>Tyrolean Alps</placeName> as seen over <placeName>Lake Constance</placeName>. More to the

        <p>Knott, &amp;c. From these the country inclines downwards to the dead flat called the
          Fild, which makes a curious contrast with the Bay, one being an expanse of water, the
          other of wood, farther than the eye can see. Bending the eye still more downward, the Town
          is seen beneath our feet more like the Map of a Town than the Town itself. The winding

          Hanging-woods wind in such Convolutions as if to prevent this rapid river getting to the sea; and in many places does it seem to
          hesitate, and pause in fine sheets. Art also lays obstacles in its way by dams for
          Cotton-Mills, Corn-Mills, Forges, &amp;c. It suffers not these interruptions peaceably,

          it.</p>
        <p><w rend="smallcaps">These</w> Sands form a prodigious Bay when the tide is in. The two arms that embrace this Bay
          are the Peninsula of <placeName>Furness</placeName> on the North, and <placeName>Rossa Point</placeName> on the South. The first part
          of it, which is crossed in the road to Ulverstone (or what the country people call <w rend="italics">Ooston</w>)
          is about eleven miles over; the road is more even than a gravel walk in a garden, and
          suffers a grand view of the rugged country that surrounds it. We enter the Sands about
          four miles from Lancaster, and taking a sweep with the eye, the first land feature is
          <placeName><hi rend="smallcaps">Farleton Knot</hi></placeName>, a huge rock as large, and very like the rock of <placeName>Gibraltar</placeName>. The various

        <p><placeName><hi rend="smallcaps">Wharton Crag</hi></placeName> is the next striking feature to the left. The limestone strata which form

          Promontory that has long withstood the buffets of old Ocean, and still defies its utmost
          fury. At the end of the eleven miles above, we arrive at this Promontory, which obstructs
          our way to Ulverstone; but not without compensation, for it affords a <hi rend="smallcaps">salt chalybeate
            spring</hi> of great salubrity, which is much resorted to in summer, the town of <placeName><w> rend="smallcaps"Cartmel</w></placeName>, and

        <p><w rend="smallcaps">Having</w> passed this Peninsula, eat flounders (called <w rend="italics">flooks</w>) at <placeName>Flookborough</placeName>, we again
          enter the Sands, and ride three miles over them before we arrive at <placeName>Ulverstone</placeName>. In crossing
          each of these Sands, we cross also two rivers, each sometimes more than half a mile wide.

          the long tail of the Horse if he could touch the bottom. No bottom was to be found! The
          tide turned, and the Man and Horse began to move towards the main sea! His heart sunk
          within him, though he still swam by the assistance of the Horse's tail. Several miles was
          he carried by this uncouth navigation, when once more he was determined to try if he was
          within soundings. Having fastened one hand in the Horse's tail, he plunged into the sea,
          and think what must have been his feelings when he felt the bottom!—<w rend="smallcaps">Providence</w></p>

        <p>DESCENDING from this bird's-eye view of the <placeName><w rend="smallcaps">Lake</w> of <w rend="smallcaps">Windermere</w></placeName>, we embark at the Ferry for
          <placeName><hi rend="smallcaps">Christian's Island</hi></placeName>. This Ferry, by the bye, seems intended by Nature; for two Peninsulas
          (called <w rend="smallcaps">Nabs</w> here) penetrate the Lake just opposite to one another, and leave a narrow
          space for the navigation. Embarking then at the Ferry, we see, from the extreme
          transparency of the water, what I have found to be the case all round the Lake, viz. that
          the ground slopes or inclines very gradually into the Lake for a few yards, and all at
          once becomes a steep brow; so that where the water would scarce reach the knee, the next
          step might precipitate the bather down a hill of many fathoms deep. This cost two boys
          their lives a few years ago, who riding a mare into the water in order to divert
          themselves with the distress of</p>
        <p>her</p>

        <p>her foal, and urging the mare over the edge of the precipice, her fore feet slid down,
          and the <roleName>boys</roleName> tumbling over her head, and clinging to the halter, drowned both themselves
          and the mare.</p>
        <p>In some places this Lake is thirty-five fathom deep, but so tranfparent that I have seen
          a fish not a pound weight attack a bait at twelve yards deep. The fail
        to the large island is charming! The mountains open into view in varied succession, and
          almost divert the eye from the cultivated scene we now arrive at.</p>
        <p><placeName><hi rend="smallcaps">Christian's Island</hi></placeName> is about a mile in length, but of very unequal width, containing about
          forty acres:—hence its shores are beautifully indented, and the present possessor (<persName>J. C,

          out, by decorating the verge with shrubbery, and a walk round the whole island, that
          follows the winding shore. This walk presents so many and such contrasted scenes of wild
          rocks and rich vallies—of barrenness and cultivation—of wood and water—of white villages
          and black moun-</p>

          fences, inclosing fields of the richest green—that the <roleName>Tourist</roleName> spontaneously stops every ten
          yards, and seems desirous of making a day's journey of the walk round this bewitching
          Island!</p>
        <p><w rend="smallcaps">Not</w> a breath of wind troubled the Lake this day; it was consequently a mirrour, and
          doubled every beauty, while my Convex Mirrour brought every scene within the compass of a

          and her sweet <w rend="smallcaps">Chiddren</w>, came with much politeness, and pressed us to partake of their
          dessert, consisting of grapes, melons, &amp;c. and much we lamented that our time would
          not permit a compliance with their wishes to detain us a few days.</p>
        <p>In our approach to the house we had an opportunity of judging how much its

          beehive, with the chimnies in the center of its convex roof. This figure, however, is
          judiciously broken by an elegant portico, near as large and very like that of <placeName>St.

          so that radii from this inner to the outer circle make the rooms more square than could be
          expected in a cylindrical figure. Beside, this figure is well calculated to withstand the

          celebrated Portrait-Painter, and <persName><w rend="smallcaps">Walker</w></persName> the Philosopher, date their origin from this
          neighbourhood.</p>
        <p><w rend="smallcaps">Cogarth</w> is an ancient residence of <persName>the Phillipsons</persName>. The estate reaches some miles on the
          border of the Lake, consisting of beautiful woods and rich pasture-ground. Between two
          semi-globular Woods is situated the large mansion now building by <persName>the <w rend="smallcaps">Bishop</w> of <w rend="smallcaps">Llandaff</w></persName>.
          Its site is so little above the level of the Lake, that I should fear the mountain
          inundations would be apt to pay it a visit. The Gardens are draining; but why the House
          and Gardens should be situated in a swamp, when the estate affords situations of every
          description, this Right Reverend <roleName>Philosopher</roleName> best knows. The House is well sheltered by
          Woods and Mountains on the North—opens finely to the Lake in</p>

          of the Lake.</p>
        <p><placeName><hi rend="smallcaps">Low Wood</hi></placeName> is only separated from the Lake by the high road leading from <placeName>Kendal</placeName> to
          <placeName>Ambleside</placeName>, and is convenient therefore for excursions on the Lake:—boats, lines, and baits
          are always ready for fishing, and the game are Perch (called <w rend="smallcaps">Bass</w> here). This social fish
          haunts particular places, particularly where an aquatic vegetable grows called <w rend="italics">Meakin</w>.
          This plant grows to be six or eight feet long, in water about ten or twelve feet deep,
          forming a curious wood. Over this wood the boat is fixed by an anchor, or a great stone
          fastened to the end of a long rope, and if the fishing-party consist of <roleName>Ladies</roleName> and
          <roleName>Gentlemen</roleName>, the sport is excellent; for every one being equipped with a line and hook, on
          which the bait is hung, a plummet sinks the bait near to the bottom, and the fishers hold
          the lines in their hands over the side of the boat. If the perch are hungry, perhaps three
          or four will bite at a time, giving the</p>

          struggling victims erect their sharp fins, so that the female <roleName>fishers</roleName> dare not touch them;
          squalling and laughter in consequence ensue—she holds her wet captive at arm's-length, who
          sprinkles her all over with water, and occasions the most laughable distress!—I know of no
          pleasanter diversion than to make one of a good-humoured fishing-party on this Lake!—
          Sometimes a large Pike will follow the captive Perch up to the very surface, and even
          make a spring out of the Lake after it.</p>
        <p>No bait yet tried will tempt the famous Charr of this or the neighbouring Lakes. This
          delicious fish is caught in nets, principally in the winter season, and potted for
          presents. The grey Trout of this Lake grows to 30 or 40 pounds weight, and goes up the
          brooks and rivers to spawn, and takes up its abode in the deepest part of the water at
          other times, and therefore is very seldom caught. The brooks which empty them-</p>

          seen sprawling on the grassy bottom of the Lake like a country inhabited by innumerable
          serpents. These are taken early in a morning by bearded spears fixed on the end of long
          poles. But this is a dangerous diversion; for as the bottom of clear water always appears
          nearer than it is, the unexperienced striker finds the Eel more distant than he expected,
          and frequently tumbles over the side of the boat.</p>
        <p>The stations on this side the Lake, for Views, are many and various. The walk from
          <placeName><hi rend="smallcaps">Low-Wood House</hi></placeName> to the <placeName><w rend="smallcaps">Dove's-nest</w></placeName> is sylvan and pretty. A Hill above <placeName><hi rend="smallcaps">Miller Ground</hi></placeName> affords

        <p>accessible rocks from the vices and follies of the world. A beautiful Lake is in the
          middle of this round Vale; and in the middle of the Lake a large Wooded Island. A flat
          Peninsula also pushes itself into the Lake, on which stands a Village of white houses, and
          a picturesque Church. The road is a terrace to this sequestered scene, and invites the

          Islands, and from it rises a vast Mountain, covered half way up with woods. And now the
          ancient seat of the <persName><w rend="smallcaps">Flemings</w></persName> salutes the eye with its white face—it flicks in the end of a
          craggy mountain like a bird's-nest in a broken wall. It is an old aukward house, but
          beautifully situated at the front of several inclining vallies, having the Town and Vale
          of <placeName>Ambleside</placeName>, with <placeName>Windermere Lake</placeName>, full in front. The large and ancient woods that clothe
          the sides of the surrounding mountains—the rich pastures at their bottoms, contrasted with

          effect; for over the head of the Cascade is an old Bridge, and over that a thicket of tall trees—and over that a dark Mountain—and.
          over that, perhaps, a dark cloud. In short, an artificial night gives a solemnity to the
          noise and indistinct view of this Cascade, which fills the mind with terror and

        <p><placeName><hi rend="smallcaps">Ings Chapel</hi></placeName> next attracts our attention as an elegant building, and more particularly by

        <p><w rend="smallcaps">About</w> the beginning of this century one <persName><w rend="smallcaps">Bateman</w></persName>, a poor lad about sixteen, had acquired a
          little knowledge of arithmetic, and wished to try his fortune in the Capital. He had
          neither money nor friends; but a laudable custom of the country operated in his favour,
          viz. After service the Congregation assemble and make a collection to help forward
          indigent merit. With this bounty in his pocket, he set off on</p>

        <p>foot, and was soon made happy in a place where he had plenty of victuals, and nothing
          to do but clean the shoes, the knives, and the stable. It was soon found out that he
          neither fold his matter's hay, wore his shoes, or pilfered candle-ends or kitchen-fat;
          nay, moreover, that he could read and write. This necessarily brought him into the
          Ware-house, where he acquitted himself so well, that the Counting-house succeeded. The
          Merchant into whose family he had the good fortune to stumble, had large concerns in
          <placeName>Italy</placeName>. Our hero was sent to <placeName>Leghorn</placeName> as a <roleName>Factor</roleName>, where he commenced <roleName>Merchant</roleName> himself,
          and in a few years acquired such a fortune that he sent over money to rebuild the Church
          where he received his first donation, and also an handsome house, seen on the left a
          little farther.</p>
        <p>I <w rend="smallcaps">am</w> happy to rescue from oblivion this <placeName>Westmoreland</placeName> <placeName><w rend="smallcaps">Whittington</w></placeName>, and wish I could
          finish his history as well as it began. Alas! he wound up his affairs, put his property
          and himself on board his last ship, and was coming to enjoy himself, and make his</p>

          poison. The ship returned to Italy the property was lost.</p>
        <p><placeName>Kendal</placeName> is a clean-looking town, and consists principally of one street, about a mile
          long. The houses are built of the rough stone of the country, so hard, that it bids
          defiance to the chisles; the interstices are filled up with rough-cast mortar, which gives
          the houses a white and uncommon appearance. The walking part of the street is paved with
          limestone pebbles, so very slip-pery, that the inhabitants acquire a catch in their walk,
          as if on ice ; and strangers often get a fall. Like most country towns, it is made up of
          good and bad houses oddly mixed together.It boasts no public building of note, except its
          Church, which is one of the largest Parish-churches in <placeName>England</placeName>.</p>
        <p>The old Castle, on a round hill opposite the town, is a slue Ruin. It incloses about an
          acre and an half of ground, and has consisted of round and square towers, united by
          curtains built on the inner bank of a deep dry ditch,</p>

        <p>surrounding the whole. The vaults (of great extent) remain, and the plan of the interior
          dwelling may be easily traced. The walls are of vast thickness, consisting of rough stones
          thrown promiscuously together, and united into an impenetrable folid by fluid mortar, now
          as, hard as the stone itself*.</p>
        <p>The situation is noble. An high hill in the middle of a Vale is a fine object of itself;
          but when crowned with a Castle in ruins, if is a Pi&amp;ure. This Castle boasts great
          antiquity. It was in possession of many eminent families long before the Conquest The
          <persName>Tailebots</persName>, the <persName>Howards</persName>, &amp;c. have possessed it since: <persName>Catherine
          Parr</persName>, the Queen of <persName>Henry VIII.</persName> was born here, and many of the <persName>Barons of Kendal</persName> who
          resided here possessed half the county for an estate.</p>
        <p> * .Fluid mortar, mixed with pounded limestone, hardens " into an impenetrable solid

        <p>On the declivity of this ground is a Tumulus as large as that at <placeName>Marlborough</placeName>, and no

        <p>The material that, furnishes bread for the numerous manufacturers of <placeName>Kendal</placeName>, is the
          coarse wool of the neighbouring mountains. This is wove into Linsey, and into Blankets for

        <p>The trade of this town will be much benefited by the <placeName>Lancaster Canal</placeName> now in
          contemplation. The reciprocation in this work will be coals and limestone <placeName>Westmoreland</placeName>
          wants coals, <placeName>Lancashire</placeName> limestone. This Canal is intended to reach from <placeName>Kendal</placeName> to
          <placeName>Lancaster</placeName>, and from thence to <placeName>Preston</placeName>, where it will join the <placeName>Leeds</placeName> and <placeName>Liverpool</placeName> Canal,
          and open a Water-communication with every part of the kingdom. Every friend to the trade
          and enterprizing spirit of these countries must give his hearty support or hearty good
          wishes to this undertaking It embraces the general good. Private views seem banished, from
          the fair and open propositions now offered to public patronage by the disinterest-ed and
          judicious patriots who have estimated its practicability, It seems very wonderful, that
          in this uneven country a Canal should be capable of extending ninety miles without a
          Lock.</p>
