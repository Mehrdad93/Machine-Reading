      <p><title>PREFACE</title>.</p>
        <p>The publishers are aware that <roleName>Tourists</roleName> have little disposition to encounter the
          tediousness of a Preface. A few words shall therefore suffice to explain the plan of the
          present work.</p>
        <p>Correct topographical description is unquestionably the most important feature of a
          Guide-Book. The <roleName>publishers</roleName> have therefore used their best efforts to securo this advantage
          for the present work, not only by employing in its compilation a gentleman thoroughly
          conversant with the district, but by submitting the sheets, as they passed through the
          press, to the revision of various other individuals, resident in the several localities
          described.</p>
        <p>The illustrated Itinerary, at the end of the volume, which comprehends all the Routes
          generally adopted by Tourists, is a feature as novel as it is useful in a Lake-Guide. Not
          only are the distances minutely stated, but the objects of interest, on either side of the
          road, are pointed out and briefly described. A Copious Index</p>
        <pb n="14" facs="2563.jp2"/>
        <p>vi</p>
        <p>PREFACE.</p>
        <p>affords the means of immediate reference to any other page of the work, where may be
          found a more detailed description of the several objects than can be included within the
          narrow columns of the Itinerary.</p>
        <p>The Lake-District is not peculiarly rich in antiquarian or traditionary lore. It will be
          found, however, that the following pages contain more matter of this description than is
          generally embraced in works of a similar nature.</p>
        <p>The Literary Associations of the district, which in contemporary Guide-Books have
          scarcely been adverted to, have in the following pages received particular notice,
          numerous quotations from the works of the Lake Poets, as well as from some of the more
          distinguished prose writers, being interspersed with the descriptive parts of the
          text.</p>
        <p>Of the external appearance of the book, the publishers will only observe, that in paper,
          printing, and embellishment, it has been their' endeavour to render it as attractive as
          they hope it will be useful.</p></div>

        <p>ABSTRACT OF TOURS.</p>
        <p>For the accommodation of strangers about to make the Tour of the Lake District, and who
          are in doubt, from the number of routes, which, and in what order to take them, we have
          drawn up an abstract of four Tours, one of which is supposed to commence and terminate at
          each of the four principal towns lying upon the edge of tho district, viz. Ulverston,
          Kendal, Penrith, and Whitehaven. By consulting the map and charts, Tourists will be able
          to vary with ease any part of the Tours here given according to their convenience ; and by
          reference to the Index, the reader will find the page of the volume, in which the objects
          mentioned in the abstract are described at length.</p>

        <p>DESCRIPTION OF THE</p>
        <p>ENGRAVINGS OF</p>
        <p>ULLESWATER AND DERWENTWATER.</p>
        <p>Of the two steel engravings which embellish this volume, the first is a view of
          <placeName>Ulleswater</placeName>, taken from an elevated part of <placeName>Gowwbarrow Park</placeName>. The <placeName>Berk Fell promontory</placeName> is
          seen projecting from the east-shore to the island called <placeName>House Holm</placeName>, beyond which, <placeName>Wall
            Holm</placeName> spots the water. Above the latter islet is <placeName>Bilberry Crag</placeName>, backed by <placeName>St. Sunday's Crag</placeName>,
          to the right of which <placeName>Fairfield</placeName> raises its mighty summit to the clouds. To the right of
          <placeName>House Holm</placeName>, <placeName>Stybarrow Crag</placeName> overhangs the margin of the lake ; over the summit of this
          crag, and through the depression between <placeName>Fairfield</placeName> and <placeName>St. Sunday's Crag</placeName>, a glimpse of some
          of the <placeName>Langdale</placeName> or <placeName>Coniston Fells</placeName> is caught. In the extreme right, <placeName>Helvellyn</placeName> towers aloft.
          The glens which run up from the lake will be readily recognised. First, on the right of
          <placeName>Stybarrow Crag</placeName> there is <placeName>Glencoyn</placeName> ; the extremity of <placeName>Glenridding</placeName> is perceived over <placeName>House
            Holm</placeName>, with <placeName>Glenridding House</placeName> on the border of the water; <placeName>Grizedale</placeName> commences on the left
          of <placeName>Bilberry Crag</placeName>, whilst <placeName>Deepdale</placeName> is seen over the <placeName>Berk Fell promontory</placeName>.</p>
        <p>The other engraving represents the upper section of <placeName>Derwentwater</placeName>, and the mountains
          surrounding the head of that lake. Immediately below the eye is the boat-house on <placeName>Barrow
            promontory</placeName> ; beyond is <placeName>Lowdore Inn</placeName>, and to the left the celebrated cascade falling between
          <placeName>Shepherd's Crag</placeName> and <placeName>Gowder Crag</placeName>. Far away above, <placeName>Scawfell Pikes</placeName>, and its rival summit,
          <placeName>Scawfell</placeName>, pierce the air. <placeName>Castle Crag</placeName> occupies a conspicuous situation at the head of the
          lake, <placeName>Glaramara</placeName> rises behind. A small portion of <placeName>St. Herbert's Isle</placeName> is visible, the rest
          being concealed by some trees in the foreground.</p>

        <p>THE</p>
        <p>PICTURESQUE GUIDE</p>
        <p>TO</p>
        <p>THE ENGLISH LAKES.</p>
        <p>INTRODUCTION. .</p>
        <p>That section of <placeName>England</placeName>, to the scenery of which this small volume professes to be a
          Guide, occupies a portion of the three counties of <placeName>Cumberland</placeName>, <placeName>Westmorland</placeName>, and <placeName>Lancaster</placeName>,
          and extends over an area, the greatest length and breadth of which arc not more than
          forty-five miles. The picturesque attractions of the district are probably unequalled in
          any other part of <placeName>England</placeName>; and although some of the <placeName>Scottish lochs</placeName> and mountains must be
          admitted to present prospects of more imposing grandeur, it may safely be said, that no
          tract of country in <placeName>Britain</placeName> combines in richer affluence those varied features of
          sublimity and beauty which have conferred upon this spot so high a reputation.</p>
        <pb n="22" facs="2571.jp2"/>
        <p>2</p>
        <p>INTRODUCTION.</p>
        <p>For the lover of nature, no tour could be devised of a more pleasing character than that
          which these Lakes afford. We penetrate the <placeName>Glaciers</placeName>, and traverse the <placeName>Rhone and the Rhine</placeName>,
          whilst our domestic lakes of <placeName>Ullswater</placeName>, <placeName>Keswick</placeName>, and <placeName>Winder-mere</placeName> exhibit scenes in so
          sublime a style, with such beautiful colourings of rock, wood, and water, backed with so
          stupendous a disposition of mountains, that if they do not fairly take the' lead of all
          the views of <placeName>Europe</placeName>, yet they are indisputably such as no <roleName>English traveller</roleName> should leave
          behind him.*</p>
        <p>Nor is it only to the admirer of external nature that this spot presents attractions. It
          is no less interesting to the antiquarian, the geologist, and the botanist. The remains of
          three Abbeys,--<placeName>Furness</placeName>, <placeName>Calder</placeName>, and <placeName>Shap</placeName>,--of numerous Castles,of one or two <trait type="ethnicity"><label>Roman</label></trait>
          Stations,and of many 
          <trait type="ethnicity"><label>Druidical</label></trait> erections,
          afford ample scope for the research of the
          antiquarian; whilst the rich variety of stratified and unstratified rocks, forming a
          complete series from the granitic to the carboniferous beds;and many rare plants, with
          ample facilities for observing the effect produced upon vegetation by the varying
          temperature of the air at different altitudes, yield to the students of geology and of
          botany abundant matter for employment in their respective pursuits.</p>
        <p>A further interest is imparted to the locality from its being the spot with which many of
          our great modern <roleName>poets</roleName> have been more or less intimately con-</p>
        <p>*<placeName>CUMBERLAND</placeName>.</p>
        <pb n="23" facs="2572.jp2"/>
        <p>INTRODUCTION.</p>
        <p>3</p>
        <p>nected, and from which many of their finest poems have emanated. In directing the steps
          of the <roleName>tourist</roleName> we have, therefore, availed ourselves to a considerable extent of the
          literature of the district, quoting those passages from the works of the <persName>Lake Poets</persName> which
          illustrate the scenery through which he will pass. These quotations, we feel assured, will
          not only contribute to elevate the feelings and improve the heart, while the <roleName>reader</roleName> is
          contemplating the scenes which are portrayed, but will also form a spell by which, in
          coming years, he may recall the pleasures of the past, and revisit, in imagination, the
          scenery over which we are now about to conduct him.</p>
        <p>As the district may be traversed by many routes, the selection of which will depend upon
          the <roleName>Tourists</roleName> convenience and taste, but especially upon the point from which he
          approaches, we conceive that we shall best consult his accommodation by arranging our
          information under general heads,such as Towns, Lakes, Mountains, &amp;c., instead of
          describing the several objects at the requisite length in the routes by which he will be
          conducted to them. By these means the difficulty and trouble the <roleName>Tourist</roleName> would experience
          in the continual reference from one route to another for the information he may require,

        <p><placeName>KENDAL</placeName>.</p>
        <p><placeName>Kendal</placeName>, otherwise <placeName>Kirkby Kendal</placeName>, the largest town in <placeName>Westmorland</placeName>, is situate in a
          pleasant valley on the banks of the river <placeName>Kent</placeName>, from which it derives its name. It
          contains about 12,000 <roleName>inhabitants</roleName>, and is a place of considerable manufacturing industry,
          having a large trade in woollen goods. The woollen manufacture was founded as early as the
          fourteenth century, by some <roleName>Flemish weavers</roleName>, who settled here at the invitation of Edward
          III.* The town is intersected by four leading streets, two of which, lying north and
          south, form a spacious thoroughfare of a mile in length.<!--fm inverted dagger--> The

          "Excepting these, (the lines of the principal streets), all the houses seem as if they had
          been dancing a country dance, and wore out. There they stand, back to back, corner to
          corner, some up hill, some down hill, without intent or meaning." The complaint may still

          to the mountains. The houses, built of the limestone which abounds in the neighbourhood,
          possess an air of cleanliness and comfort,their white walls contrasting pleasingly with
          numerous poplars, which impart a cheerful rural aspect to the town.</p>
        <p>The Barony of Kendal was granted by <persName>William the Conqueror</persName> to <persName>Ivo de Taillebois</persName>, one of

          freedom confirmed by a charter from one of his <roleName>descendants</roleName>. The barony now belongs, in
          unequal portions, to the <persName>Earl of Lonsdale</persName> and the <persName>Hon. F. G. Howard</persName>, both of whom have
          extensive possessions in Westmorland. An incorporation of <roleName>aldermen</roleName> and <roleName>burgesses</roleName> was
          established by <persName>Queen Elizabeth</persName> ;* <persName>James I</persName>. entrusted it to a <roleName>mayor</roleName>, twelve <roleName>aldermen</roleName>, and
          twenty <roleName>burgesses</roleName>; and by the Municipal Corporations Reform Act the government of the
          borough is now vested in a <roleName>mayor</roleName>, six <roleName>aldermen</roleName>, and eighteen <roleName>common councillors</roleName>, six of
          whom are elected by each of the three wards into which it is divided. By the Reform Act,
          which disfranchised <placeName>Appleby</placeName>, the county</p>
        <p>* It is singular that under <persName>Queen Elizabeth</persName>'s Charter the borough had no <roleName>Mayor</roleName>. To this

          <persName>Stricklands</persName>. The oldest part appears to have been erected about the year <date>1200</date>. The tower
          is square, and possesses an altitude of 72 feet. Like most other ecclesiastical structures
          of ancient date, it contains a number of enrious monuments and epitaphs.* There are two

        <p>this fortress are well worthy of a visit, on account of the views of the town and valley
          which the hill commands. This was the ancient seat of the <roleName>Barons of Kendal</roleName> and the
          birthplace of <persName>Catherine Parr</persName>, the last queen of <persName>Henry VIII</persName>., a <roleName>lady</roleName>, who (as <persName>Pennant</persName>
          quaintly remarks), had the good fortune to descend to the grave with her head, in all
          probability, merely by outliving her tyrant. Opposite to the castle, on the west side of
          the town, is <placeName>Castle-how-hill or Castle-low-hill</placeName>, a large circular mount of gravel and
          earth, round the base of which there is a deep fosse, strengthened with two bastions on
          the east. It is of great antiquity, and is supposed by some to have been one of those
          hills called <emph>Laws</emph>, where in ancient times justice was administered. In <date>1788</date>,
          a handsome obelisk was erected on its summit in commemoration of the Revolution of
          <date>1688</date>.</p>
        <p>About a mile to the south of the town, at a spot where the river almost bends upon
          itself, and hence called <placeName>Water Crook</placeName>, are the scarcely perceptible remains of the <trait type="ethnicity"><label>ethnicity</label><desc>Roman</desc></trait>
          Station, <emph><placeName>Concangium</placeName></emph>, formerly a place of some importance, judging from the
          number of urns, tiles, and other relics of antiquity discovered there. It is believed that
          a watch was stationed at this point for the security of the <trait type="ethnicity"><label>Roman</label></trait> posts at <placeName>Ambleside</placeName> and
          <placeName>Overborough</placeName>. In the walls of a farm house in the vicinity are two altars, a large stone
          with a sepulchral inscription, and a mutilated statue.</p>
        <p>One mile and a half to the west, at the termination of a long ascent over an open moor,
          is the bold escarpment of limestone rock, called UNDERBARROW (or Scout) SCAR. It is a
          remarkable object, and</p>

        <p>would repay the trouble of a visit by the splendid view of the distant lake mountains,
          and the interjacent country, which it commands. A hill, rising abruptly on the east of the
          town, termed <placeName>Benson-Knott</placeName>, has an altitude of 1098 feet above the level of the sea. From
          the summit of this hill, an extensive prospect is also obtained.</p>
        <p>LEVENS HALL, the seat of the <persName>Hon. Fulk Gre-ville Howard</persName>, five miles south of <placeName>Kendal</placeName>, is a
          venerable mansion, in the Elizabethan style, buried among lofty trees. The park, through
          which the river Kent winds betwixt bold and beautifully wooded banks, is separated by the
          turnpike road from the house. It is of considerable size, well-stocked with deer, and
          contains a noble avenue of ancient oaks. The gardens, however, form the greatest
          attraction, being laid out in the old <trait type="ethnicity"><label>French</label></trait> style, of which this is perhaps a unique
          example in the kingdom. They were planned by <persName>Mr. Beaumont</persName>, (whose portrait, very properly,
          is preserved in the Hall,) <roleName>gardener</roleName> to <persName>King James II</persName>. Trim alleys, bowling-greens, and
          wildernesses fenced round by sight-proof thickets of beech, remind tho beholder, by their
          antique appearance, of times "long, long ago." In one part, a great number of yews,
          hollies, laurels, and other evergreens, are cut into an infinite variety of grotesque
          shapes.</p>

        <p>The gardens, as may be imagined, harmonize well with the old Hall, the interior of which

        <p>The work in the south drawing-room is exceedingly rich, as may be conceived from its

          The carved chimney-piece in the Library is a curious and interesting piece of workmanship.
          The two jambs represent <persName>Hercules</persName> and <persName>Samson</persName>--the one armed with the ass's jaw-bone, the

        <p>The valley of <placeName>Ambleside</placeName>, on the border of which the town stands, is well wooded, and

          and <placeName>Rydal Lakes</placeName>, and joins the <placeName>Brathay</placeName>, shortly before entering <placeName>Windermere</placeName>. Upon <placeName>STOCK

          copsewood, about 700 yards from the <placeName>Market Cross</placeName>, the road to which passes behind the
          <placeName>Salutation Inn</placeName>. The fall, or rather falls, for there are four, are 70 feet in height.
          Portions of all four are visible from the usual stand ; but the views may be pleasingly
          varied by descending the bank to the stream, or proceeding further up the Gill. Indeed, if
          the walk were continued for a mile alongside the stream, which rises in the Screes on

          <placeName>Windermere</placeName>, with its islands; hut on account of the altitude of the spectator, the view is
          not so fine as that from another part of the Pike, called <placeName>Troutbeck Hundreds</placeName>, a little to
          the south.</p>
        <p>The village of <placeName>RYDAL</placeName>, supposed to be a contraction of <placeName>Rothay-dale</placeName>, is placed in a narrow
          gorge, formed by the advance of <placeName>Louglirigg Fell</placeName> and <placeName>Rydal Knab</placeName>, at the lower extremity of
          <placeName>Rydal Mere</placeName>, one mile and a quarter from <placeName>Ambleside</placeName>. Here, in the midst of a park containing
          great numbers of noble forest trees,* stands <placeName>Rydal Hall</placeName>, the seat of <persName>Lady le Fleming</persName>. The
          celebrated falls are within the park, and strangers desirous to view them, must take a
          conductor from one of the cottages near the hall gates. The fall below the house is beheld
          from the window of an old summer house. Here, says <persName>West</persName>, nature has performed every thing
          in little, which she usually executes on her larger scale; and on that account, like the
          miniature <roleName>painter</roleName>, seems to have finished</p>
        <p>* "The sylvan, or say rather the forest scenery of <placeName>Rydal Park</placeName>, was, in the memory of
          living men, magnificent, and it still contains a treasure of old trees. By all means
          wander away into those old woods, and lose yourselves for an hour or two among the cooing
          of cushats, and the shrill shriek of startled blackbirds, and the rustic of the harmless
          glow-worm among the last years red beech-leaves. No very great harm should you even fall
          asleep under the shadow of an oak, while the magpie chatters at safe distance, and the
          more innocent squirrel peeps down upon you from a bough of the canopy, and then hoisting
          his tail, glides into the obscurity of the loftiest umbrage."--<persName>PROFESSOR WILSON</persName>.</p>

        <p>every part of it in a studied manner; not a little fragment of a rock thrown into the
          basin, not a single stem of brushwood that starts from its craggy sides, but has its
          picturesque meaning ; and the little central stream, dashing down a cleft of the darkest
          coloured stone, produces an effect of light and shadow, beautiful beyond description. This
          little theatrical scene might be paintod as large as the original, on a canvass not bigger
          than those usually dropped in the opera house. Amongst the juvenile poems of <persName>Wordsworth</persName>

          <l>Beyond, along the vista of the brook,</l>
          <l>Where antique roots its bristling course o'erlook,</l>

        <p>"It must rejoice every man who joins in the homage offered to <persName>Wordsworth's</persName> powers, (and
          what man is to be found who more or less does not?) to hear, with respect to one so
          lavishly endowed by nature, that he has not been neglected by fortune; that he has never
          had the finer edge of his sensibilities dulled by the sad anxieties, the degrading fears,
          the miserable dependencies of debt; that he has been blest with competency, even when
          poorest; has had hope and cheerful prospects in reversion through every stage of his life;
          that at all times he has been liberated from reasonable anxieties about the final
          interests of his children ; that at all times he has been blessed with leisure, the very
          amplest that ever man enjoyed, for intellectual pursuits the most delightful; yes, that,
          even for those delicate and coy pursuits, he has possessed, in combination, all the
          conditions for their most perfect culture--the leisure--the case--the solitude--the
          society--the domestic peace--the local scenery--Paradise for his eye, in Miltonic beauty,
          lying outside his windows--Paradise for his heart, in the perpetual happiness of his own
          fireside; and finally, when increasing years might be supposed to demand something more of
          modern luxuries, and expanding intercourse with society, in its most polished forms,
          something more of refined elegancies, that his means, still keeping pace in almost
          arithmetical ratio with his wants, had shed the graces of art upon the failing powers of
          nature, had stripped infirmity of discomfort, and (so far as the necessities of things

        <p>under <placeName>Loughrigg Fell</placeName>, is extremely delightful. Though more circuitous than the highway,
          it presents finer combinations of scenery. The <roleName>tourist</roleName>, intending to take this round,
          should pursue the road to <placeName>Clappersgate</placeName> for half a mile to <placeName>Rothay Bridge</placeName>, and having
          crossed the bridge, enter the first gate on the right. The road leads alongside the river,
          passing many handsome villas, to <placeName>Pelter Bridge</placeName>, 2 1/2 miles. <placeName>Rydal Fall</placeName>, with its park,
          and <placeName>Rydal Mount</placeName>, will be frequently in sight. Behind, <placeName>Ambleside</placeName>, backed by <placeName>Wansfell</placeName>, has a
          picturesque appearance. On the right are the heights of <placeName>Fairfield</placeName> and <placeName>Kirkstone</placeName>. By
          crossing the bridge, the <placeName>Keswick road</placeName> will be gained, and the <roleName>tourist</roleName> can then either
          return to <placeName>Ambleside</placeName>, or proceed to <placeName>Rydal</placeName>, which is 300 or 400 yards further. Those who are
          fond of long walks, ought to abstain from crossing the bridge, but, keeping to the left,
          pursue the road behind the farm house, called <placeName>Coat How</placeName>, which loads along the south-west
          shore of <placeName>Rydal Mere</placeName>. This mere being passed, the road ascends the hill side steeply for
          some time, until it reaches a splendid terrace, overlooking <placeName>Grasmere Lake</placeName>, with its single
          islet, and then, climbing again, joins on <placeName>Red Bank</placeName>, the <placeName>Grasmere and Langdale road</placeName>.* Here
          the <roleName>tourist</roleName> has the choice of returning</p>

          short, by all that miraculous prosperity can do to evade the primal decrees of naturehad
          placed the final stages upon a level with the first. This report of <persName>Wordsworth's</persName> success,
          will rejoice thousands of good hearts.</p>
        <p>* This is by far the best station for viewing the <placeName>Lake and Vale of Grasmere</placeName>. Probably it
          was this very view that called from <persName>Mrs. Hemans</persName> her sonnet entitled</p>

        </lg>
        <p>The vale of <placeName>Grasmere</placeName> is also beautifully described by the <roleName>poet</roleName> <persName>Gray</persName>.-- "The bosom of the
          mountains, spreading here into a broad basin, discovers in the midst <placeName>Grasmere water</placeName>; its
          margin is hollowed into small bays, with eminences, some of rock, some of soft turf, that
          half conceal and vary the figure of the little lake they command: from the shore, a low
          promontory pushes itself far into the water, and on it stands a white village, with a
          parish church rising in the midst of it; hanging enclosures, corn fields, and meadows,
          green as an emerald, with their trees and hedges, and cattle, fill up the whole space from
          the edge of the water; and just opposite to you is a'large farm-house, at the bottom of a
          steep smooth lawn, embosomed in old woods, which climb half-way up the mountain-sides, and
          discover above a broken line of crags that crown the scene, Not a single red tile, no
          staring gentlemans house, breaks in upon the repose of this unsuspected paradise; but all
          is peace, rusticity, and happy poverty, in its sweetest, most becoming attire."</p>
        <p><persName>Wordsworth</persName> has also sketched Grasmere in the following lines:</p>
        <lg type="poem">
          <l>Upon a rising ground a grey church tower,</l>
          <l>Whose battlements were screend by tufted trees.</l>

            Bank</placeName>, the residence of <persName>Thomas Dawson, Esq.</persName>, stands on a platform of ground behind the
          village. This house was, for some time, the abode of <persName>Wordsworth</persName>. The house, however, in
          which he lived for many years, and in which he composed many of his most beautiful pieces,
          is at <placeName>Grasmere Town End</placeName>.* The singularly shaped hill, called <placeName>Helm Crag</placeName>, is conspicuously
          visible from <placeName>Grasmere</placeName>. Its apex exhibits so irregular an outline, as to have given rise to
          numberless whimsical comparisons. <persName>Gray</persName> compares it to a gigantic building demolished, and
          the stones which composed it flung across in wild confusion. And <persName>Wordsworth</persName> speaks of</p>
        <p>"The ancient Woman seatod on <placeName>Helm Crag</placeName>."</p>

        <p>A pleasing excursion, of ten miles, into the retired side-valley of <placeName>TROUTBECK</placeName>, may be

        <p>practicable for <roleName>horsemen</roleName> and <roleName>pedestrians</roleName> only, those who take conveyances will be
          compelled to return by the road they went, as soon as they arrive at the head of
          <placeName>Troutbeck</placeName>, unless they proceed by way of <placeName>Kirkstone</placeName> to <placeName>Patterdale</placeName>. The <roleName>tourist</roleName> must pursue
          the <placeName>Kendal road</placeName> for two miles, and take the first road on the left when he has passed <placeName>Low
            Wood Inn</placeName>. From the eminences of this road, many exquisite views of <placeName>Windermere</placeName> are
          obtained; and, perhaps, the finest view of the lake that can be had from any station, is
          that from the highest part of it. The mountains in the west present an admirable outline,

        <p>"There is not, says <persName>Professor Wilson</persName>, "such another splendid prospect in all <placeName>England</placeName>. The
          lake has much of the character of a river, without losing its own. The islands are seen
          almost all lying together in a cluster--below which all is loveliness and beauty --above,
          all majesty and grandeur. Bold or gentle promontories break all the banks into frequent
          bays, seldom without a cottage or cottages embowered in trees; and, while the whole
          landscape is of a sylvan kind, parts of it are so laden with woods, that you see only here
          and there a wreath of smoke, but no houses, and could almost believe that you are gazing

        <p>of <placeName>Troutbeck</placeName> is reached, at a point about a mile from <placeName>Troutbeck Bridge</placeName>. The rude
          picturesqueness of its many-chimneyed cottages, with their unnumbered gables and
          slate-slab porticoes, will not be passed unnoticed by the tourist, as he bends his way
          towards the hills. "The cottages (says the <roleName>writer</roleName> from whom our last extract was made)
          stand for the most part in clusters of twos and threes, with here and there what in
          <placeName>Scotland</placeName> is called a clachan,--many a sma' toun within the ae lang toun--but where in all
          broad <placeName>Scotland</placeName> is a mile-long scattered congregation of rural dwellings, all dropped down
          where the <roleName>Painter</roleName> and the <roleName>Poet</roleName> would have wished to plant them, on knolls and in dells, on
          banks and braes, and below tree-crested rocks, and all bound together in picturesque
          confusion, by old groves of ash, oak, and sycamore, and by flower gardens and fruit
          orchards, rich as those of the Hesperides?" The road pursues the western side of the
          valley, at some distance from the lowest level, which is occupied by the stream giving its
          name to the village. On the opposite side, <placeName>the Howe</placeName>, the residence of <persName>Captain Wilson,
            R.N.,</persName> will be observed, and further on, the chapel is perceived on the banks of the
          stream, near the bridge, by which the roads are connected. That on the east side is the
          most direct road from <placeName>Bowness</placeName> to the valley, but it is objectionable on account of its not
          conducting the <roleName>traveller</roleName> through the village. The road on the western flank joins the
          <placeName>Kendal and Ambleside road</placeName> at <placeName>Troutbeck Bridge</placeName>, keeping throughout on the banks of the
          stream, the meanderings of which, on its way to <placeName>Windermere</placeName>, round rugged scaurs and
          wooded</p>

        <p>banks, are continually in sight. Half a mile beyond the chapel, is the only inn in the
          valley, bearing the quaint title of "<placeName>The Mortal Man</placeName>",--a name acquired from the lines,
          composed, doubtless, by some <roleName>native poet</roleName>, which a few years ago decorated the
          signboard--</p>

          <l>It is with drinking Birketts ale."</l>
        </lg>
        <p>Two miles beyond the inn, the <roleName>tourist</roleName> has immediately below him, a tongue or swelling
          from the bottom of the vale called <placeName>Troutbeck Park</placeName>, which is visible even from the surface
          of <placeName>Windermere</placeName>. Taking his station here, and turning to the north-cast, the <roleName>spectator</roleName> has
          the mountains of <placeName>Kentmere</placeName> before him. The nearest elevation is called the <placeName>Yoke</placeName>, the two
          next, having the appearance of the humps on a dromedarys back, are <placeName>Hill Bell</placeName> and
          <placeName>Froswick</placeName>,--and further on is <placeName>High Street</placeName>. Having left <placeName>the Mortal Man</placeName> three miles behind,
          and climbed the side of <placeName>Kirkstone</placeName> for some distance, a road through the fields, on the
          left, will be discovered, which passes in succession three farmhouses, <placeName>High Grove</placeName>, <placeName>Middle
            Grove</placeName>, and <placeName>Low Grove</placeName>, in <placeName>Stockdale</placeName>, and enters <placeName>Ambleside</placeName>, three miles from the
          deviation.</p>
        <p>A favourite excursion, with the <roleName>temporary residents</roleName> in <placeName>Ambleside</placeName>, is that through the two
          <placeName>LANGDALES</placeName>. If the object of the <roleName>tourist</roleName> be merely to view the vale of <placeName>Great Langdale</placeName> (the
          finer of the two) with <placeName>Dungeon Gill Force</placeName>, and to ascend the <placeName>Pikes</placeName>, he will traverse a

          <placeName>Little Langdale</placeName> and <placeName>Blea Tarns</placeName>, he must be content to go on horseback, in a car, or on
          foot. This circuit, which we shall describe, is about eighteen miles in length. With the
          intention, then, of visiting the two <placeName>Langdales</placeName> in succession, the <roleName>tourist</roleName> will leave
          <placeName>Ambleside</placeName> by the road to <placeName>Clappersgate</placeName>, winding on the banks of the <placeName>Brathay</placeName>, (near the
          source of which he will be ere long,) under the craggy heights of <placeName>Louglirigg Fell</placeName>. A newly
          built chapel will be observed in a charming situation on the south bank of the river.
          "Sweeter stream-scenery," says <persName>Wilson</persName>, "with richer fore, and loftier back ground, is no
          where to be seen within the four seas." A few hundred yards above <placeName>Skelwith Bridge</placeName> (three
          miles from <placeName>Ambleside</placeName>) the stream is precipitated over a ledge of rock, making a fall
          twenty feet in height. The cascade is not so remarkable in itself, as for the magnificent
          scenery around it. <placeName>Langdale Pikes</placeName> have a peculiarly striking appearance. By this bridge
          the <roleName>traveller</roleName> is conducted into <placeName>Lancashire</placeName>, in which county the road does not continue for
          more than a mile before it reenters <placeName>Westmorland</placeName> at <placeName>Colwith Bridge</placeName>. A short distance above
          the bridge, the stream, issuing from a tarn farther up, makes a fine cascade called
          <placeName>Colwith Force</placeName>. It is in a dell close to the road, and is about 70 feet high. A stupendous
          mountain, called <placeName>Wetherlamb</placeName>, occupies a conspicuous position in a chain of lofty hills on
          the south-west. Proceeding, <placeName>Little Langdale Tarn</placeName> becomes visible on the left--on the right
          is <placeName>Lingmoor</placeName>, a hill which serves as a partition between the</p>

        <p>two <placeName>Langdales</placeName>. At the termination of the inclosed land, amongst a few trees, are two
          dwellings, called <placeName>Fell Foot</placeName>, seven and a half miles from <placeName>Ambleside</placeName>. One of them was
          formerly an inn, whereat the gangs of pack-horses were refreshed previous to their ascent
          of the mountain passes of <placeName>Wrynose</placeName> and <placeName>Hardknot</placeName> --this being the route by which the
          manufactures of <placeName>Kendal</placeName> were transported to the western coast. Taking the road to the
          right, and ascending some distance between the mountains, a solitary pool of water, named
          <placeName>Blea Tarn</placeName>, is perceived in the bottom of an elevated depression. The scene here presented
          is thus described in the Excursion; the description, however, supposes the <roleName>spectator</roleName> to
          look down upon it, not from the road, but from one of the hill sides:</p>

          and higher, <placeName>Harrison Stickle</placeName>. Having passed the tarn, the road winds down a steep descent
          into the head of <placeName>Great Langdale</placeName>, that part of it called <placeName>Mickleden</placeName>, through which is the
          road over the <placeName>Stake</placeName> into <placeName>Borrowdale</placeName>, being right before the eye. <placeName>Mill Becks</placeName>, a farm house,

          formed by a stream which runs down a fissure in the mountain's side not far above the
          house. A curious natural arch has been made, by a large stone having rolled from a higher
          part of the mountain, and got wedged in between the cheeks of rock. Over the bridge thus

          One mile and a half from <placeName>Mill Becks</placeName>, is the little <placeName>Chapel of Langdale</placeName>, whence a road

        <p><placeName>Ulverston</placeName>, a market town and port, containing about 5000 <roleName>inhabitants</roleName>, situate in that
          division of <placeName>Lancashire</placeName>, termed North of the Sands, is supposed to derive its name from
          <persName>Ulph, a Saxon Lord</persName>. It is about a mile from the estuary of the <placeName>Levon</placeName>, with which it is
          connected by a canal, constructed in <date>1795</date>, and capable of floating vessels of 200 tons.
          This canal has been of signal advantage to the town, as large quantities of slate and iron
          ore, with which the neighbourhood abounds, are hereby exported. The appearance of the town
          is neat, the greater part of the houses being of modern erection. The principal streets
          are four in number. The parish church, dedicated to <placeName>St. Mary</placeName>, received considerable
          additions in <date>1804</date>; but a tower and <trait type="ethnicity"><label>ethnicity</label><desc>Norman</desc></trait> doorway of the old structure still remain. It
          contains an altar-piece after <persName>Sir Joshua Reynolds</persName>, and a window of stained glass,
          representing compositions after <persName>Rubens</persName>, both of which were given by <persName>T.R.G. Braddyll, Esq.</persName>,
          the <roleName>Lay Rector</roleName>. From the sloping ground behind the church, a delightful view of the bay
          and neighbouring country may be obtained. A new and elegant church, dedicated to the Holy
          Trinity, was erected at the upper end of the town in <date>1832</date>, by public subscription, aided

          place of religious worship erected for tho use of that community. Over the door are the
          initials of the founder, "Ex dono G.F. <date>1688</date>." <placeName>Swart-moor Hall</placeName> was once the residence of
          <persName>Judge Fell</persName>, whose wife, and many of the family, in the year <date>1652</date>, adopted the principles
          of the <roleName>Quakers</roleName>. In <date>1669</date>, eleven years after the death of the judge, his widow married
          <persName>George Fox</persName>, whom she survived about eleven years. "In approaching Swart-moor Hall," says a
          recent <roleName>tourist</roleName>, "I crossed a narrow dell, shaded by a grove of fine beech trees, and
          watered by a murmuring brook. The old hall is overshaded by two sycamores of large growth;
          but its dilapidated condition, the barns and stables by which it is surrounded, and the
          litter of a farm-yard, give it no very classical air. I was taken into the study of <persName>George
            Fox</persName>, where he reposed and meditated in the intervals of those laborious missions which he
          undertook to persuade men to make the gospel, in all its simplicity, the standard of their
          conduct, in opposition to human customs and inventions. The bed-rooms are spacious
          apartments, and have in former days been ornamented with carved work, (which George
          doubtless found there when he succeeded to the wife and mansion of <persName>Judge Fell</persName>.) In one of
          them is a substantial old bedstead with carved posts, on which, as I was assured, the
          proto-quaker used to repose, and which any of his <roleName>followers</roleName> is permitted to occupy for a

          lately been rebuilt in a style of magnificence of which there are few examples in the
          north of <placeName>England</placeName>, occupies the site of the ancient <placeName>Priory</placeName>, founded by <persName>William de

          reign of <persName>Henry II</persName>. Upon the dissolution of the religious houses, it fell into the hands of
          <persName>Henry the VIII.</persName>, whose cupidity was excited by the great extent of its landed possessions.
          The <persName>family of Braddyll</persName> is of great antiquity and respectability. In a note to the "Bridal
          of Trier-main," <persName>Sir Walter Scott</persName> informs us that the ancient families of <persName>Vaux</persName> of

        <p>Six miles north-east of <placeName>Ulverston</placeName> is the village of <placeName>Cartmell</placeName>, in which is an ancient
          church, once a priory, of unusual size and beauty, dedicated to the Virgin. A short
          distance from the village is a medicinal spring called <placeName>Holywell</placeName>. Six miles and a half to
          the south-west of <placeName>Ulverston</placeName>, in a close valley called <placeName>Beckansgill</placeName>, or the glen of deadly
          nightshade, from that plant being found there in great abundance, are the beautiful
          remains of <placeName>FURNESS ABBEY</placeName>, now belonging to the <persName>Earl of Burlington</persName>. This abbey was founded
          in <date>1127</date>, by <persName>Stephen, Earl of Montaigne and Boulogne</persName>, afterwards <persName>King of England</persName>; This
          prince conferred the greater part of the district, excepting the land of <persName>Michael Fleming</persName>,
          on the <placeName>Abbey of Furness</placeName>, by a charter dated <date>1126</date>, in which, for the first time, the name
          <placeName>Furness 'Fudernesia' or the further ness</placeName>, is found. By this institution it was held till
          the dissolution, when it reverted to the crown, and became parcel of the duchy of
          <placeName>Lancaster</placeName>. In the year <date>1662</date>, it was granted by <persName>Charles II.</persName> to the <persName>Duke of Albemarle</persName>, and
          his heirs, with all the rights, privileges, and jurisdictions belonging thereto. The
          lordship is now held by the <persName>Duke of Buccleuch</persName> and <persName>Lord Beaulieu</persName>, to whom the property of
          the Duke of Albemarle descended by marriage. In the early part of English history, the
          Falls of Furness formed the boundary between <placeName>Scotland</placeName> and <placeName>England</placeName>, and in <date>1138</date>, a terrible
          eruption from the north laid the whole peninsula desolate. The ruins of the</p>
        <p>finest pictures are scattered over this part of the country. There is a very fine
          collection at <placeName>Whitestock Hall</placeName>, the residence of his daughter-in-law, near <placeName>Hawkshead</placeName>.</p>

        <p>The ruins amply attest the former magnificence of the structure. The length of the church
          is 287 feet, the nave is 70 feet broad, and the walls in some places 54 feet high, and 5
          feet thick. The walls of the church, and those of the chapter-house, the refectorium, and
          the school-house, are still in great part remaining, and exhibit fine specimens of Gothic
          architecture; the chapter-house, 60 feet by 45, has been a sumptuous apartment; the roof,
          which was of fret-work, was supported by six channelled pillars. The great east window,
          the four seats near it, adorned with Gothic ornaments, and four statues found in the
          ruins, are particularly worthy of notice.<!--fm inverted dagger--></p>

        <p>shade. A thick grove of plane trees, with some oak and beech, overshadow it on the right,
          and lead the eye onward to the ruins of the abbey, seen through this dark arch in remote
          perspective, over rough but verdant ground. The principal features arc the great northern
          window, and part of the eastern choir, with glimpses of shattered arches and stately walls
          beyond, caught between the gaping casements. On the left, the bank of the glen is broken
          into knolls, capped with oaks, which, in some places, spread downwards to a stream that
          winds round the ruin, and darken it with their rich foliage. Through this gate is the
          entrance to the immediate precincts of the abbey, an area said to contain sixty-five
          acres, now called the deer-park. It is enclosed by a stone wall, on which the remains of
          many small buildings, and the faint vestiges of others,still appear, such as the porters
          lodge, mills, granaries, ovens, and kilns, that once supplied the monastery; some of
          which, seen under the shade of the fine old trees, that on every side adorn the broken
          steeps of this glen, have a very interesting effect.</p>
        <p>"Just within the gate, a small manor-house of modern date, with its stables and other
          offices, breaks discordantly upon the lonely grandeur of the scene. Except this, the
          character of the deserted ruin is scrupulously preserved in the surrounding area. We made
          our way among the pathless fern and grass to the north end of the church, now, like every
          other part of the abbey, entirely roofless, but showing the lofty arch of the great
          window, where, instead of the painted glass that once enriched it, are now tufted</p>

        <p>plants and wreaths of nightshade. Below is the principal door of the church, bending into
          a deep round arch, which, retiring circle within circle, is rich and beautiful; the
          remains of a winding staircase are visible within the wall on its left side. Near this
          northern end of the edifice is seen one side of the eastern choir, with its two slender
          Gothic window-frames; and on the west, a remnant of the nave of the abbey, and some lofty
          arches, which once belonged to the belfry, now detached from the main building.</p>
        <p>"To the south, but concealed from this point of view, is the chapter-house, some years
          ago exhibiting a roof of beautiful Gothic fret-work, and which was almost the only part of
          the abbey thus ornamented, its architecture having been characterized by an air of grand
          simplicity, rather than by the elegance and richness of decoration, which, in an after
          date, distinguished the Gothic style in <placeName>England</placeName>. Over the chapter-house were once the
          library and scriptorium; and beyond it are still the remains of cloisters, of the
          refectory, the locutorium, or conversation-room, and the calefactory. These, with the
          walls of some chapels, of the vestry, a ball, and of what is believed to have been a
          scliool-house, are all the features of this noble edifice that can easily be traced;
          winding staircases within the surprising thickness of the walls, and door cases involved
          in darkness and mystery, the place abounds with.</p>

        <p>rocks, now changed by time and weather to a tint of dusky brown, which accords well with
          the hues of plants and shrubs that every where emboss the mouldering arches.</p>
        <p>"The finest view of the ruin is on the east side, where, beyond the vast shattered frame
          that once contained a richly painted window, is seen a perspective of the choir and of
          distant arches, remains of the nave of the abbey, closed by the woods. This perspective of
          the ruin is said to be two hundred and eighty-seven feet in length; the choir part of it
          is in width only twenty-eight feet inside, but the nave is seventy; the walls, as they now
          stand, are fifty-four feet high, and in thickness five. Southward from the choir extends
          the still beautiful, though broken, pillars and arcades of some chapels, now laid open to
          the day; the chapter-house, and cloisters, and beyond all, and detached from all, is the
          school-house, a large building, the only part of the monastery that still boasts of a
          roof.</p>
        <p>Of a quadrangular court on the west side of the church, three hundred and thirty-four
          feet long, and one hundred and two feet wide, little vestige now appears, except the
          foundation of a range of cloisters that formed its western boundary, and under the shade
          of which the monks, on days of high solemnity, passed in their customary procession round
          the court. What was the belfry is now a huge mass of detached ruin, picturesque from the
          loftiness of its shattered arches, and the high inequalities of the ground within them,
          where the tower that once crowned this building, having fallen, lies in vast fragments,
          now cover-</p>

        <p>ed with earth and grass, and no longer distinguishable but by the hillock they form.</p>
        <p>"The school-house, a heavy structure attached to the boundary wall on the south, is
          nearly entire, and the walls, particularly of the portal, are of enormous thickness; but,
          here and there, a chasm discloses the staircases that wind within them to the chambers
          above. The school-room below shows only a stone bench, that extends round the walls, and a
          low stone pillar on the eastern corner, on which the teachers pulpit was formerly fixed.
          The lofty vaulted roof is scarcely distinguishable by the dusky light admitted through one
          or two narrow windows placed high from the ground, perhaps for the purpose of confining
          the scholars attention to his book.</p>
        <p>"These are the principal features' that remain of this once magnificent abbey. It was
          dedicated to <persName>St. Mary</persName>, and received a colony of <roleName>monks</roleName> from the <placeName>monastery of Savigny in
            Normandy</placeName>, who were called <roleName>Grey Monks</roleName>, from their dress of that colour, till they became
          <roleName>Cistercians</roleName>, and with the severe rules of <persName>St. Bernard</persName>, adopted a white habit, which they
          retained till the dissolution of monastic orders in <placeName>England</placeName>.</p>
        <p>"The privileges and immunities granted to the Cistercian order in general were very
          abundant; and those to the Abbey of Furness were proportioned to its vast endowments. The
          <roleName>abbot</roleName>, it has been mentioned, held his secular court in the neighbouring <placeName>castle of Dalton</placeName>,
          where he presided, with the power of administering not only justice, but injustice, since
          the lives and property of the villain tenants of the lordship of Furness were consigned by

        <p><persName>King Stephen</persName> to the disposal of my <roleName>lord abbot</roleName>! The <roleName>monks</roleName> also could be arraigned, for
          whatever crime, only by him. The military establishment of Furness likewise depended on
          the abbot. Every <roleName>mesne lord</roleName> and <roleName>free homager</roleName>, as well as the customary <roleName>tenants</roleName>, took an
          oath of fealty to the <roleName>abbot</roleName>, to be true to him against all men, excepting the <roleName>king</roleName>. Every
          <roleName>mesne lord</roleName> obeyed the summons of the <roleName>abbot</roleName>, or his <roleName>steward</roleName>, in raising his quota of armed
          men, and every <roleName>tenant</roleName> of a whole tenement furnished a man and a horse of war for guarding
          the coast, for the border-service, or any expedition against the common enemy of the <roleName>king</roleName>
          and kingdom. The habiliments of war were a steel coat, or coat of mail, a falce, or
          falchion, a jack, the bow, the byll, the cross-bow, and spear. The Furness legion
          consisted of four divisions:--one of <roleName>bowmen</roleName> horsed and harnessed; <roleName>bylmen</roleName> horsed and
          harnessed; <roleName>bowmen</roleName> without horse and harness; <roleName>bylmen</roleName> without horse and harness.</p>
        <p>"The deep forests, that once surrounded the abbey, and overspread all <placeName>Furness</placeName>,
          contributed with its insulated situation, on a neck of land running into the sea, to

          scarcely suggest the full magnificence of such a prospect, to which the monks, emerging
          from their concealed cells below, occasionally resorted to soothe the asperities which the
          severe discipline of superstition inflicted on the temper; or, freed from the observance
          of jealous eyes, to indulge, perhaps, the sigh of regret, which a consideration of the
          world they had renounced, thus gloriously given back to their sight, would sometimes
          awaken.</p>

        <p>is about half a mile from the town. A scene of more luxuriant beauty than this lake
          affords can scarcely be imagined. Its shape is symmetrical without being formal, while its
          size is neither so large as to merge the character of the lake in that of the inland sea,
          nor so circumscribed as to expose it to the charge of insignificance. The admirers of
          nature are divided in opinion as to the respective merits of this lake and <placeName>Ulleswater</placeName>;
          some assigning the palm of superiority to the one and some to the other. Those who are
          familiar with the Alpine scenery of <placeName>Scotland</placeName>, which so far surpasses in savage grandeur
          any thing within the limits of the sister country, almost uniformly give the preference to
          Derwentwater, while those who have not possessed opportunities of contemplating nature in
          her sterner moods are more deeply impressed with the more majestic attributes of her
          rival.*</p>

        <p>of rocks that rise immediately beyond, and are again overlooked by others. The precipices
          seldom overshoot the water, but are arranged at some distance; and the shores swell with
          woody eminences, or sink into green pastoral margins. Masses of wood also frequently
          appear among the cliffs, feathering them to their summits; and a white cottage sometimes
          peeps from out their skirts, seated on the smooth knoll of a pasture projecting to the
          lake, and looks so exquisitely picturesque, as to seem placed there purposely to adorn it.
          The lake in return faithfully reflects the whole picture, and so even and brilliantly
          translucent is its surface, that it rather heightens than obscures the colouring.*</p>
        <p>The principal islands in the lake are <placeName>Vicars Isle</placeName>, <placeName>Lords Island</placeName>, and <placeName>St. Herberts Isle</placeName>.
          <placeName>VICAR'S ISLE or DERWENT ISLE</placeName> is that nearest the foot of the lake; it contains about six
          acres, and belongs to <persName>Captain Henry</persName>, whose residence is upon it. This island was formerly
          an appurtenant to <placeName>Fountains Abbey</placeName> in <placeName>Yorkshire</placeName>. <placeName>LORD'S ISLAND</placeName>, of a size somewhat larger
          than the last, has upon it the hardly perceptible remains of a pleasure house erected by
          one of the <persName>Ratcliffes</persName> with the stones of their deserted castle which stood on Castle-rigg.
          This island was once connected with the mainland, from which it was severed by the
          <persName>Ratcliffes</persName>, by a fosse, over which a drawbridge was thrown. It is now the property of <persName>Mrs.
            Marshall</persName>, and family. <placeName>ST. HERBERT'S ISLE</placeName>, placed nearly in the centre of the lake, derives
          its name from a <roleName>holy hermit</roleName> who lived</p>
        <p>*So transparent is the water that pebbles may be easily seen fifteen or twenty feet below
          its surface.</p>

          still visible. To <persName>St. Cuthbert of Durham</persName> this "saintly eremite" bore so perfect a love as
          to pray that he himself might expire the moment the breath of life quitted the body of his
          friend, so that their souls might wing their flight to heaven in company. <persName>Wordsworth</persName>'s
          inscription for the spot where the hermitage stood, from which the following lines are
          taken, is founded upon this legend.</p>
        <lg type="stanza">
          <l>-------------------"When, with eye upraised</l>

            both</l>

          <l>Far from St. Cutlibert his beloved friend,</l>
          <l>Those holy men both died in the same hour."</l>
        </lg>
        <p>Near the ruins, the late <persName>Sir Wilfred Lawson</persName>, (to whose representative the island at
          present belongs,) erected a few years ago a small cottage, which being built of unhewn
          stone, and artificially mossed over, has a venerable appearance. There are three or four
          other islets, the largest of which is <placeName>Rampsholm</placeName>. At irregular intervals of a few years,
          the lake exhibits a singular phenomenon in the rising of a piece of ground, called <placeName>THE
            FLOATING ISLAND</placeName>, from the bottom to the surface of the water. Its superficial extent,
          varies in different years, from an acre to a few</p>

        <p>perches. It is composed of earthy matter, six feet in thickness, covered with vegetation,
          and is full of air bubbles, which, it is supposed, by penetrating the whole mass, diminish
          its specific gravity, and are the cause of its buoyancy. This natural phenomenon is
          situate about 150 yards from the shore, near <placeName>Lowdore</placeName>.</p>
        <p>The walks in the neighbourhood of <placeName>Keswick</placeName> are numerous and interesting. From <placeName>Crow Parle</placeName>
          and <placeName>Friar Crag</placeName>, two places situate on the east shore, near the foot of the lake, beautiful
          views of the lake, vale, and surrounding mountains are obtained. From a wooded eminence
          called <placeName>Castle Head</placeName>, standing on the left of the <placeName>Borrowdale road</placeName>, about half a mile from
          <placeName>Keswick</placeName>, there is an enchanting prospect, extending on the south into the "Jaws of
          Borodale," in which <placeName>Castle Crag</placeName> appears like a prominent front tooth. Cat Bells, on the
          other side of the lake, are fine objects, as well as the other mountains which tower over
          the vale of <placeName>Newlands</placeName>. From a summit, called <placeName>Castlerigg</placeName>, one mile from <placeName>Keswick</placeName> on the
          <placeName>Ambleside road</placeName>, there is a most extensive view, comprising the lakes of <placeName>Derwentwater</placeName> and
          <placeName>Bassenthwait</placeName>e, the fertile vale through which the <placeName>Derwent</placeName> winds on its passage from the
          one lake to the other, and the heights of <placeName>Skiddaw</placeName>. <persName>Gray</persName> declares that, on leaving Keswick,
          when he turned round at this place to contemplate the scenery behind him, he was so
          charmed "that he had almost a mind to go back again." A walk over <placeName>Latrigg</placeName>, <placeName>Skiddaws Cub</placeName>,
          will furnish the stranger with innumerable delightful prospects; and, in fact, it is
          impossible to stir in the neighbourhood of <placeName>Keswick</placeName>,</p>

        <p>without having scenery of the finest description before the eye. One mile and a half from
          <placeName>Keswick</placeName>, on an eminence to the right of the old road to <placeName>Penrith</placeName>, is a small <trait type="ethnicity"><label>ethnicity</label><desc>Druidical</desc></trait>
          Circle, measuring 100 feet by 108, consisting of forty-eight stones, some of which are
          seven feet high.</p>
        <p>Perhaps an excursion exhibiting more beautiful prospects of rock, wood, and water, than
          that round <placeName>Derwentwater</placeName>, does not exist in the vicinity of the Lakes. It is not more than
          ten miles in length, if <placeName>Grange Bridge</placeName> be the limit of the ride in that direction ; but if
          the excursion be extended to <placeName>Bowder Stone</placeName>, two miles must be added. Leaving <placeName>Keswick</placeName> by the
          <placeName>Borrowdale road</placeName>, <placeName>Castle Head</placeName>, <placeName>Wallow Crag</placeName>, and <placeName>Falcon Crag</placeName>, are successively passed on the
          left. A hollow in the summit of <placeName>Wallow Crag</placeName> is visible from the road. There is a tradition
          current in the country, that by means of this hollow the <persName>Countess of Derwentwater</persName> effected
          her escape when the <roleName>Earl</roleName> was arrested for high treason, carrying with her a quantity of
          jewels and other valuables. It has ever since borne the name of the Lady's Rake. <placeName>Barrow
            House</placeName> <persName>(Jos. Pocklington, Esq.)</persName> stands two miles from <placeName>Keswick</placeName>, on the left of the road.
          Behind the house there is a fine cascade 124 feet in height, which may be seen on
          application at the lodge. A mountain road strikes off at this point to the village of
          <placeName>Watendlath</placeName>, two miles from the deflection. The road, after passing the village, near which
          there is a tarn, re-enters the Borrowdale road a little beyond <placeName>Bowder Stone</placeName>. In making the
          ascent to the village, splendid views of the lake and <placeName>Skiddaw</placeName> are obtained.</p>

        <p>51</p>
        <p>One mile beyond <placeName>Barrow</placeName>, the road having passed under <placeName>Thrang Crag</placeName>, is the little inn of
          <placeName>Lowdore</placeName>, behind which is the celebrated <placeName>Lowdore Waterfall</placeName>. The grandeur of the rocks
          around the stream render tho scene impressive, whatever may be the state of the weather,
          but the cascade is dependent in a great measure for its effect on the quantity of water.
          After heavy rains, the noise of the fall may be heard as far down the lake as <placeName>Friar Crag</placeName>.
          <placeName>Gowder Crag</placeName> rises on the left, <placeName>Shepherd's Crag</placeName> on the right, of the waterfall. One mile
          further, <placeName>Grange Bridge</placeName>, spanning <placeName>Borrowdale Beck</placeName>, is attained. Should the <roleName>tourist</roleName> desire
          to see the curious mass of rock called <placeName>Bowder Stone</placeName>, the road into <placeName>Borrowdale</placeName> must be
          continued for a mile further. This immense block, which hits evidently rolled from the
          heights above, stands on it platform of ground, a short distance to the left of the road.
          A branch road has been made to the Stone, which rejoins the <placeName>Borrowdale road</placeName> further on. It
          has been computed to weigh upwards of 1900 tons. Its summit may be gained by means of a
          ladder which has been affixed to it for the use of strangers.</p>

          found here are shown in one of the museums at <placeName>Keswick</placeName>. Returning to and crossing <placeName>Grange
            Bridge</placeName>, the village of <placeName>Grange</placeName> is passed, and, one mile beyond, are a few houses called
          <placeName>Manesty</placeName>, near which is a small medicinal spring. Passing under the summit styled <placeName>Cat
            Bells</placeName>, the road enters the pretty village of <placeName>Portin-scale</placeName>, 4 3/4 miles from <placeName>Grange Bridge</placeName>,
          near which are many elegant villas. <placeName>Keswick</placeName> is but a mile and a quarter beyond.</p>
        <p>An agreeable excursion of thirteen miles and a half may be made from <placeName>Keswick</placeName> into the
          famed <placeName>VALLEY OF ST. JOHN</placeName>. The <placeName>Penrith road</placeName> must be pursued for four miles, to the village
          of <placeName>Threlkeld</placeName>. This road, lying almost the whole way on the banks of <placeName>the Greta</placeName>,*</p>
        <p>*Upon the <placeName>river Greta</placeName>, <persName>Wordsworth</persName> has composed the following sonnet:--</p>
        <lg type="stanza">
          <l>"Greta, what fearful listening! when huge stones</l>
          <l>Rumble along thy bed, block after block;</l>
          <l>Or, whirling with reiterated shock,</l>
          <l>Combat, while darkness aggravates the groans.</l>
          <l>But if thou (like Cocytus, from the moans</l>
          <l>Heard on his rueful margin) thence wert named</l>
          <l>The Mourner, thy true nature was defamed;</l>
          <l>And the habitual murmur that atones</l>
          <l>For thy worst rage forgotten. Oft as spring</l>
          <l>Decks on thy sinuous banks her thousand thrones--</l>
          <l>Seats of glad instinct and of loves carolling--</l>
          <l>The concert, for the happy, then may vie</l>
          <l>With liveliest peals of birthday harmony--</l>
          <l>To a grieved heart the notes are benisons."</l>
        </lg>
        <p>The channel of <placeName>the Greta</placeName>, immediately above <placeName>Keswick</placeName>, has, for the purposes of building,
          been in a great measure cleared of the immense stones which, by their concussion in high
          floods, produced the loud and awful noises described in the sonnet.</p>
        <p>The scenery upon this river, (says <persName>Dr. Southey</persName>,) where it passes under the woody side of

          <placeName>Blencathara</placeName>.)* In a recess of the latter mountain, deeply embosomed in huge cliffs, there
          lies a piece of water called <placeName>Scales Tarn</placeName>, which exaggerating travellers have described as
          an abyss of waters upon which the sun never shines, and wherein the stars of heaven may be
          seen at noon-day. <persName>Sir Walter Scott</persName> alludes to this fable in these lines of the
          Bridal:--</p>
        <lg type="stanza">

          <l>In whose black mirror you may spy</l>
          <l>The stars while noon-tide lights the sky."</l>
        </lg>
        <p>In the same tarn, tradition asserts that two immortal fish have their abode. Amongst the
          acknowledgments which the <roleName>Minstrel</roleName>, in his "Song at the feast of <placeName>Brougham Castle</placeName>," states
          had been made to the secret power of the good <persName>Lord Clifford</persName>, when a shepherd boy in

          <roleName>knight</roleName> in the reign of <persName>Henry VII.</persName>, and uncle to the <persName>Lord Clifford</persName> above mentioned, who was
          wont to say that "he had three noble houses--one for pleasure, <placeName>Crosby</placeName> in <placeName>Westmorland</placeName>,
          where he had a park full of deer; one for profit and warmth, namely, <placeName>Yanwith</placeName>, nigh

        <p>GUIDE TO THE LAKES.</p>
        <p><placeName>Buttermere</placeName> stands on declining ground near the foot of the lake fourteen miles from
          <placeName>Keswick</placeName>. It consists of a few scattered farm houses, with a good inn, forming by reason of
          the surrounding hills the very picture of seclusion. "The margin of the lake, which is
          overhung by some of the loftiest and steepest of the <placeName>Cumbrian mountains</placeName>, exhibits on
          either side few traces of human neighbourhood; the level area, where the hills recede
          enough to allow of any, is of a wild pastoral character or almost savage. The waters of
          the lake are deep and sullen, and the barrier mountains, by excluding the sun for much of
          his daily course, strengthen the gloomy impressions. At the foot of this lake lie a few
          unornamented fields, through which rolls a little brook connecting it with the larger lake
          of <placeName>Crummock</placeName>, and at the edge of this miniature domain, upon the road side, stands a
          cluster of cottages so small and few that in the richer tracts of the island they would
          scarcely be complimented with the name of hamlet."* A good road of nine miles, after
          climbing a Haws 800 feet high, conducts the <roleName>visitor</roleName> through the vale of <placeName>Newlands</placeName> to
          <placeName>Keswick</placeName>. A small chapel has been erected at the expense of the <persName>Rev. Vaughan Thomas</persName>, by the
          road side, upon the site of a still smaller one. The old chapel has been thus described:--
          "It is not only the very smallest chapel, by many degrees, in all <placeName>England</placeName>, but is so mere
          a toy in outward appearance, that were it not for its antiquity, its wild mountain

          looks not so much a miniature chapel in a drop scene from the Opera House, as a miniature
          copy from such a scene, and evidently could not receive within its walls more than half a
          dozen households."*</p>
        <p>The story of <persName>Mary, the beauty of Buttermere</persName>, is now, from its repeated publication, very
          generally known--briefly stated it is this:--She was possessed of considerable personal
          charms, and being the daughter of the <roleName>innkeeper</roleName>, her usual employment was to wait upon
          those guests, who at that time, made their way so far into the heart of the hills. Her
          beauty thus became the theme of what may be called extensive praise. A man, who designated
          himself the <persName>Honourable Col. Hope</persName>, brother of <persName>Lord Hopetoun</persName>, but whose real name was
          <persName>Hatfield</persName>, had fled from the arm of the law to these sequestered parts. Being struck with
          her attractions, he paid his addresses to, and married her, but no great length of time
          elapsed before he was apprehended on a charge of forgery. He was tried at <placeName>Carlisle</placeName>, and
          being found guilty suffered the extreme penalty of the law. Mary married for her second
          husband a respectable <roleName>farmer</roleName> of <placeName>Calbeck</placeName>, and died a few years ago.</p>
        <p>A footpath leading through the fields, and across the little stream connecting the two

        <p>especially, is none of the cleanest, and therefore a boat is frequently taken, which
          lands the <roleName>visitor</roleName> about half a mile from the fall. A mountain path, leaving <placeName>Scale Force</placeName> on
          the left and climbing the fells above it, leads into <placeName>Ennerdale</placeName>. <placeName>Floutern Tarn</placeName>, which is
          passed on the way, serves as a landmark.</p>
        <p>Extending the excursion to <placeName>SCALE HILL</placeName>, four miles from <placeName>Buttermere</placeName>, the road traverses the
          eastern shore of <placeName>Crummock Water</placeName>, passing under the hills <placeName>Whiteless</placeName>, <placeName>Grasmoor</placeName> and
          <placeName>Whiteside</placeName>. <placeName>Melbreak</placeName> is a fine object on the other shore. From the foot of this mountain a
          narrow promontory juts into the lake, the extremity of which, when the waters are swollen,
          becomes insulated. A short distance before <placeName>Scale Hill</placeName> is reached, there is a fine view
          into the sylvan valley of <placeName>Lorton</placeName>. At <placeName>Scale Hill</placeName> there is a comfortable inn, which for a
          few days might be made advantageously the <roleName>Tourist</roleName>'s residence. Boats may be had upon
          <placeName>Crummock Lake</placeName>, from which the inn is about a mile distant. <placeName>Scale Force</placeName> might be visited if
          not seen previously. One boating excursion at least ought to be taken for the purpose of
          viewing the fine panorama of mountains which enclose the lake, and which can be no where
          seen to such advantage as from the bosom of the water. <persName>Green</persName> has pointed out one station
          for obtaining a fine view not only of <placeName>Crummock Lake</placeName> but of <placeName>Buttermere</placeName> also. It is from a
          point two or three hundred yards above the promontory under <placeName>Melbreak</placeName>; <placeName>Honister Crag</placeName> is
          seen closing the prospect on the north. The lake is three miles long by about three
          quarters of a mile broad; its sounded depth is twenty-two fathoms. There are</p>

        <p>three small islands at the head, but they are too near the shore to add much to the other
          beauties of the scenery. The small lake called <placeName>Lowes Water</placeName> may also be visited. It is
          scarcely a mile long, and the scenery at its head is tame, but that round its foot is of a
          magnificent description.</p>
        <p>From <placeName>Scale Hill</placeName> the <roleName>Tourist</roleName> may proceed to the town of <placeName>Cockermouth</placeName>, the birthplace of the
          poet <persName>Wordsworth</persName>, which is seven miles distant--visit <placeName>Ennerdale Water</placeName> by way of
          <placeName>Lamplugh</placeName>--or return to <placeName>Keswick</placeName> by the vale of <placeName>Lorton</placeName>, a distance of twelve miles. This
          vale, watered by the <placeName>Cocker</placeName>, a stream which, issuing from <placeName>Cruinmock Lake</placeName>, joins the
          <placeName>Derwent</placeName> at <placeName>Cockermouth</placeName>, presents many charming views. Four miles from <placeName>Scale Hill</placeName> the

          the road under <placeName>Whiteside</placeName> and <placeName>Grisedale Pike</placeName> be taken. For the <roleName>horseman</roleName> and <roleName>pedestrian</roleName> the
          shorter route is to be preferred, as that part under the mountains forms a terrace, from
          which, views of <placeName>Lorton Vale</placeName>, of the neighbouring hills, and extending even to the Scotch
          mountains, may be obtained.</p>
        <p>WHITEHAVEN.</p>
        <p><placeName>WHITEHAVEN</placeName> is a market town and sea-port, seated at the upper end of a small creek on the
          west coast in the county of <placeName>Cumberland</placeName>. It is situate in the parish of <persName>St. Bees</persName>, and
          contains about 15,000 inhabitants. This town has advanced rapidly from insignificance to
          its present state of prosperity, for in the year <date>1566</date> six <roleName>fishermen</roleName>'s huts were all that
          bore the name of <placeName>Whitehaven</placeName>. This sudden progress in the scale of importance is to be
          attributed in a great measure to the munificence of the <persName>Lowther family</persName>, who, having large
          estates around the town, and valuable possessions in coal underneath it, have liberally
          come forward on all occasions, when opportunities have occurred, to promote its
          prosperity.</p>
        <p>The chief manufactures are coarse linens, and articles connected with the fitting up of
          vessels; shipbuilding is also carried on to a considerable extent. The port is the second
          in the county, there</p>

        <p>being upwards of 200 vessels belonging to it trading witli the sea-ports of <placeName>Great
          Britain</placeName>, and with <placeName>America</placeName>, the <placeName>West Indies</placeName>, and the <placeName>Baltic</placeName>, as well as almost an equal
          number engaged in the coal trade; large quantities of iron and lead ore, grain, and lime
          are exported. The harbour is spacious and commodious, having seven piers extending into
          the sea in different directions, and affording ample security for vessels lying within. At
          the entrance of the harbour there are two light-houses, and a third is situate on the
          promontory of <placeName>St. Bees Head</placeName>, three miles to the south-west. A machine, called the
          patent-slip, erected by <persName>Lord Lonsdale</persName>, into which vessels are drawn with ease and
          expedition when repairs are required, deserves a visit. The bay and harbour are defended
          by batteries, formerly consisting of upwards of a hundred guns, but lately suffered to
          fall into decay. These batteries received extensive additions after the alarm caused by
          the descent of the notorious <persName>Paul Jones</persName> in <date>1778</date>. This <roleName>desperado</roleName>, who was a <roleName>native of
            Galloway</roleName>, and had served his apprenticeship in <placeName>Whitehaven</placeName>, landed here with thirty armed

          expedition. The success of the enterprise was, however, frustrated by one of the company,
          through whom the <roleName>inhabitants</roleName> were placed on the alert. The only damage they succeeded in
          doing was the setting fire to three ships, only one of which was burnt. They were obliged
          to make a precipitate retreat, having first spiked the guns of the battery, so that they
          escaped unhurt to the coast of <placeName>Scotland</placeName>, where they</p>

          here,--which has been the means of saving many lives.</p>
        <p>The streets of the town have a neat appearance, being straight as well as wide, and
          intersecting each other at right angles. A rivulet called the <placeName>Poe</placeName> runs underneath the town
          to the creek. There are three churches of the establishment,--<placeName>St. Nicholas</placeName>, erected in
          <date>1693</date>, <placeName>Trinity</placeName> in <date>1715</date>, and <placeName>St. James</placeName> in <date>1752</date>; there are also many dissenting places of
          worship. The schools are numerous, educating more than 1700 children, nearly 500 of whom
          are taught at the <placeName>National School</placeName>. At the <placeName>Savings Bank</placeName>, the deposits amount to upwards of
          60,000. The <placeName>Theatre</placeName> in <placeName>Roper Street</placeName> has a handsome appearance; it was erected in <date>1769</date>. The
          <placeName>Workhouse</placeName> is a large building in <placeName>Scotch Street</placeName>. The <placeName>Subscription Library</placeName>, a neat edifice
          in <placeName>Catherine Street</placeName>, contains about 3500 volumes. The <placeName>Harbour Office</placeName>, in which the affairs
          of the harbour, docks, and customs are transacted, is a large structure on the <placeName>West
            Strand</placeName>. The <placeName>Public Office</placeName>, containing a police office, newsroom, &amp;c., stands in
          <placeName>Lowther Street</placeName>. Two Newspapers are published weekly, the Cumberland Pacquet, and the

        <p>The coal mines are the principal source of wealth at <placeName>Whitehaven</placeName>. They are, perhaps, the
          most extraordinary in the world, lying underneath the town, and extending a considerable

        <p>vast quantities of coal have been excavated from them as to have given them the
          appearance of a subterranean city. At times of pressing demand, 1500 tons are frequently
          taken to the shore for exportation each day. In the early part of <date>1791</date>, the ground
          underneath a portion of the town gave way, and eighteen houses were in consequence
          injured, but the occupiers fortunately escaped unhurt. The sea has not unfrequently burst
          into the mines, causing an immense destruction of life and property ; the <roleName>miners</roleName> are also
          much annoyed with fire-damp and choke-damp. There are many short railways to convey the
          coal to the shore, and steam-engines of great power are in continual operation for the
          purpose of carrying off the superfluous water. The mines have five principal entrances,
          called Bearmouths, three on the south side and two on the north, by all of which horses
          can descend.</p>

          twice a-week to and from <placeName>Liverpool</placeName>; and as this mode of reaching <placeName>Whitehaven</placeName> is much more
          economical and expeditious than the inland one, many persons avail themselves of it for

        <p>The village which gives its name to the <placeName>parish of St. Bees</placeName>, in which <placeName>Whitehaven</placeName> is
          situated, lies in a narrow valley near the shore, four miles to the south of <placeName>Whitehaven</placeName>.
          Its appellation is said to be derived from <persName>St. Boga</persName>, an <trait type="ethnicity"><label>ethnicity</label><desc>Irish</desc></trait> virgin and <roleName>saint</roleName>, who lived
          here in the odour of sanctity, and founded a monastery, about the year <date>650</date>. The church,
          which was erected some time after her death, was dedicated to her, and is still in a state
          of excellent preservation. The tower is the only part of the <trait type="ethnicity"><label>ethnicity</label><desc>Saxon</desc></trait> edifice remaining, the
          rest being in the florid Gothic style. It is built of red freestone, in a cruciform shape,
          and possesses some fine carvings, particularly at the east end, which is lighted by three
          lancet-shaped windows. The nave is used as the parish church, and the cross aisle as a
          place of burial. Until <date>1810</date> the chancel was unroofed, but in that year it was repaired,
          and is now occupied as the divinity school for the recep-</p>

        <p>GUIDE TO THE LAKES.</p>
        <p><placeName>ENNERDALE LAKE</placeName> is less visited than most of the other lakes, in consequence of the
          difficulty of access and the want of houses of entertainment in the valley. It lies nine
          miles to the east of <placeName>Whitehaven</placeName>, from which town it is more easily reached than from any
          other. Its length is not more than two miles and a half, and its extreme width is about
          three quarters of a mile. The stream which enters at its head is called the <placeName>Liza</placeName>, but the
          river issuing from the lake takes the name of <placeName>Ehen</placeName>. This stream is crossed for the first
          time by those approaching the lake five miles from <placeName>Whitehaven</placeName>, and a second time three
          miles further up, at the village of <placeName>Ennerdale Bridge</placeName>, at which is the chapel, and near it
          two small inns; the foot of the lake is one mile beyond. One mile from the lower extremity
          of this mere a solitary rock rises from the water almost in the centre; at this point
          <placeName>Revelin</placeName> presents a bold front on the south shore, and a hill called <placeName>Herdhouse</placeName> stands on
          the north shore. Opposite the islet the pedestrian may cross the fells on the north,
          taking <placeName>Floutern Tarn</placeName> as a guide, and descend between <placeName>Melbreak</placeName> on the left and <placeName>Blea Crag</placeName> on
          the right into <placeName>Buttermeredale</placeName>; this road is about six miles long. The first mile and a
          half of <placeName>Ennerdale Water</placeName> is the most picturesque part, and, therefore, carriages need not
          proceed further along the road than this distance, as there is no outlet for them at the
          upper end of the valley. The <roleName>pedestrian</roleName> or <roleName>horseman</roleName> will do well to traverse the whole
          length of the vale, as the mountains round its upper end are thrown into magnificent
          groups. Long before reaching the head</p>

        <p>ENNERDALE LAKE.</p>
        <p>71</p>
        <p>of the lake the scenery becomes wild and desolate. A mile and a half beyond the extremity
          is the farm house of <placeName>Gillerthwaite</placeName>, the last habitation in the vale. Here the road for
          vehicles ends. A <roleName>shepherd</roleName>'s path passes along the banks of the <placeName>Liza</placeName>, and two miles and a
          half beyond <placeName>Gillerthwaite</placeName> the extremity of <placeName>Ennerdale</placeName> is reached. <placeName>Great Gable</placeName> (2925 feet)
          is a fine object at the head; and the <placeName>Pillar</placeName> (2893 feet) has a striking appearance on the
          right. <placeName>Great Gable</placeName> is so called from its resembling the gable-end of a house. On the
          summit there was wont to be a small hollow in the rock never entirely empty of water,
          having, says <persName>Wordsworth</persName>, no other feeder than the dews of heaven, the showers, the
          vapours, the hoar frost, and the spotless snow. This rock is now destroyed. The peculiar
          shape of the <placeName>Pillar</placeName> will not fail to strike the eye for some distance.</p>
        <lg type="stanza">
          <l>"You see yon precipice;--it wears the shape</l>

        <p>A sheep cote at the termination of the valley will be noticed. At this point a path
          strikes up the hill on the left, called <placeName>Scarf Gap</placeName>, and reaches <placeName>Gatescarth</placeName> in <placeName>Buttermere</placeName>,
          by a road three miles in length. Another path passes over <placeName>Black Sail</placeName> on the right, and
          winding round <placeName>Kirkfell</placeName> into <placeName>Mosedale</placeName>, having <placeName>Yewbarrow</placeName> on the right, reaches <placeName>Wastdale

        <p><placeName>WAST WATER</placeName>.</p>
        <p>The road from <placeName>Whitehaven</placeName> to <placeName>Wast Water</placeName> lies through the town of <placeName>Egremont</placeName>. Two miles and a
          half beyond <placeName>Egremont</placeName>, on the right, is the village of <placeName>Beckermet</placeName>. A house near this
          village, the residence of <persName>Joseph Hartley, Esq.</persName>, bears the name of <placeName>Wotobank</placeName>, from the hill
          near which it stands. The derivation of the name is assigned by tradition to the following
          incident. A <roleName>Lord of Beckermet</roleName>, with his <roleName>lady</roleName> and <roleName>servants</roleName>, were one day hunting wolves.
          During the chase the <roleName>lady</roleName> was discovered to be missing. After a long and painful search,
          her body was found on this hill or bank slain by a wolf, which was discovered in the very
          act of tearing it to pieces. In the first transports of his grief the husband exclaimed,
          "Woe to this bank!"</p>
        <lg type="stanza">

        <p>The road crosses <placeName>Calder Bridge</placeName> four miles from</p>
        <pb n="113" facs="2662.jp2"/>
        <p><placeName>CALDER ABBEY</placeName>.</p>
        <p>73</p>
        <p><placeName>Egremont</placeName>. There are two good inns in the village. Close at hand is <placeName>Ponsonby Hall</placeName>, the
          residence of <persName>J.E. Stanley, Esq.</persName> in a beautiful park. One mile above the village, on the
          north bank of the stream, are the picturesque remains of <placeName>Calder Abbey</placeName>, consisting of a
          square tower of the church, which is supported by pointed arches, sustained on four finely
          clustered columns, about twenty-four feet in height, and of excellent workmanship. The
          roof of the church rested on semicircular arches, with clustered pillars, and a fascia,
          which is yet to be traced above the remaining arches. The width of the choir appears to
          have been only twenty-five feet. The ruins are overrun with ivy, and are delightfully
          embowered in stately sycamores and other trees. <persName>Ranulph de Meschiens</persName> founded this
          monastery in <date>1134</date>, for a colony of <trait type="ethnicity"><label>ethnicity</label><desc>Cistercians</desc></trait> who were detached from <placeName>Furness Abbey</placeName>. It
          subsequently received many valuable grants. At the dissolution it shared the common fate
          of the <trait type="ethnicity"><label>ethnicity</label><desc>Romish</desc></trait> ecclesiastical establishments. Its yearly revenue at that time amounted,
          according to Speed, to £64, 3s. 9d. Near the abbey is the neat residence of <persName>Captain Irwin</persName>,
          in whose grounds the ruins stand.</p>
        <p>In the church yard at <placeName>Gosforth</placeName>, six miles from <placeName>Egremont</placeName>, there is an ancient stone
          pillar, which, until lately, was surmounted by a cross. The pretty village of <placeName>Strands</placeName> is
          four miles beyond <placeName>Gosforth</placeName>. It has two decent inns, at which boats on the lake may be
          procured. The ascent of <placeName>Scawfell Pikes</placeName> may be conveniently made from this place, by taking
          a boat to the head of the lake and landing at the foot of</p>

        <p>the mountain. <placeName>Wast Water</placeName>, one mile from <placeName>Strands</placeName>, is three and a half miles in length, and
          about half a mile broad. The deepest part yet discovered is forty-five fathoms. It has
          never been known to be iced over, even in the severest winter. The mountains round this
          lake rise to a great altitude. <placeName>The Screes</placeName> hang over the south-east margin, and form an
          extraordinary feature in the landscape. <placeName>Seatallan</placeName> guards the opposite shore. The road
          traverses the north-western shore, and, six miles from <placeName>Strands</placeName>, arrives at the village of
          <placeName>Wastdale Head</placeName>, which consists merely of a few scattered homesteads and a little chapel. It
          would be a great accommodation to tourists if there were an inn at this place. Refreshment
          can, however, be obtained at one of the farm-houses, for which, of course, some
          remuneration will be given. The panorama of mountains surrounding this level area is
          strikingly grand. Standing at the head of the lake, the spectator will have <placeName>Yewbarrow</placeName>,
          like the slanting roof of a house, on his left, further up, <placeName>Kirkfell</placeName>, and immediately
          before him <placeName>Groat Gable</placeName>,--a little on the right of which is <placeName>Lingmell</placeName>, a protrusion from
          <placeName>Scawfell</placeName>--<placeName>the Pikes</placeName>, (the highest land in <placeName>England</placeName>,) and <placeName>Scawfell</placeName> then follow.* Between
          <placeName>Yewbarrow</placeName> and <placeName>Kirkfell</placeName> there is the path over <placeName>Black Sail</placeName> into <placeName>Ennerdale</placeName>, before noticed. A
          foot road, passing round the head of the lake, and climbing the high ground between the
          <placeName>Screes</placeName> and <placeName>Scawfell</placeName>, descends by way of <placeName>Burnmoor Tarn</placeName> into <placeName>Eskdale</placeName>. <roleName>Tourists</roleName> on foot or

          the right. The summit, 1300 feet high, commands, as may be imagined, a most extensive
          view. The ascent is remarkably steep; and if horses are taken over, great caution should
          be used. The notorious <persName>Baron Trenck</persName> once dashed down on horseback, leaving his astonished
          <roleName>guide</roleName> behind carefully picking his way. The fearless <roleName>horseman</roleName> arrived safe at the bottom,
          and performed in one day a journey of fifty-six miles, through steep and difficult roads,
          which nearly killed his horse.</p>
        <p>PENRITH.</p>
        <p><placeName>PENRITH</placeName> is an ancient market town, seated at the foot of an eminence near the southern
          verge of the county of <placeName>Cumberland</placeName>. It contains about 6000 inhabitants, and the appearance
          of the town is clean and neat. The houses are principally built of the red freestone,
          which abounds in the neighbourhood ; whence probably the name of the town is
            derived--<emph>Pen</emph> and <emph>rhudd</emph>, words signifying in the British
          language, <emph>red hill</emph>. It lies in the neighbourhood of three rivers, the
          <placeName>Lowther</placeName>, <placeName>Eamont</placeName>, and <placeName>Petterill</placeName>, within the district called <placeName>Inglewood Forest</placeName>. When the

        <p>It was described as "a goodly great forest, full of woods, red deer, and fallow deer,
          wild swine, all manner of wild beasts, called the <placeName>Forest of Inglewood</placeName>." The tract was of a
          triangular shape, the length of its sides measuring upwards of twenty miles. The <trait type="ethnicity"><label>ethnicity</label><desc>Scots</desc></trait>
          frequently made themselves masters of it, and were as frequently expelled, until by an
          arrangement between the <roleName>kings</roleName> of the two countries in <date>1237</date>, it was finally ceded to
          <placeName>England</placeName>. Subsequently it lapsed to the crown, and was conferred by <persName>William III.</persName>, upon the
          first <roleName>Earl of Portland</roleName>. The existence of <placeName>Penrith</placeName> may be traced back for many centuries. An
          army of 30,000 <trait type="ethnicity"><label>ethnicity</label><desc>Scots</desc></trait> laid it waste in the nineteenth year of <persName>Edward III.</persName>, carrying away
          many of the <roleName>inhabitants</roleName> prisoners, and in the reign of <persName>Richard III.</persName> the town was again
          sacked. The manufactures are very trifling, consisting principally of linen goods and some
          woollen fabrics.</p>
        <p>The ruins of the <emph>Castle</emph>, supposed to have been erected by <persName>Edward V.</persName>,
          overlook the town from the west, and give it a noble appearance. It was for some time the
          residence of the <roleName>Duke of Gloucester</roleName>, afterwards <persName>Richard III.</persName>, and continued in the
          possession of the <roleName>Crown</roleName> till the Revolution, when it was granted, together with the honour
          of <placeName>Penrith</placeName>, to <persName>Walter Bentinck, Earl of Portland</persName>. In the contest between <persName>Charles I.</persName> and
          the <roleName>Long Parliament</roleName>, this castle was seized and dismantled, by the adherents of the
          <placeName>Commonwealth</placeName>, and the load, timber, and other materials, were sold. In <date>1783</date>, the late <roleName>Duke
            of Portland</roleName> sold it, together with the honour of <placeName>Penrith</placeName>, including <placeName>Inglewood Forest</placeName>, to

        <p>The <emph>Church</emph> is a plain structure; it was partly rebuilt in <date>1722</date>, and is

          tapering from a circumference of eleven feet six inches at the base to seven feet at the
          top. Between these are four other stones; the whole are covered with <trait type="ethnicity"><label>ethnicity</label><desc>Runic</desc></trait> or other

          <placeName>Appleby road</placeName>. The vallum of an encampment is still to be traced, and altars, coins and
          other antiquities have often been found at the place. The earliest recorded owner of the

          In <date>1412</date>, whilst in the possession of the <persName>Clifford</persName> family, it was attacked and laid waste

          <persName>Cliffords</persName> were intimately connected with the early history of <placeName>Westmorland</placeName>, a sketch of the
          more distinguished of them may not, perhaps, be deemed out of place here. They were a
          warlike sept, and engaged in all the contests of the time, so that it was a rare thing for
          any to die off the field. They doubtless felt, or imagined they felt, that</p>

        <p>The first of the family who gained a fooling in the county, was the <persName>Roger de Clifford</persName>
          above referred to. His son <persName>Robert</persName> was said to have been the greatest man of all the
          family, being of a most martial and heroic spirit. He was one of the <roleName>guardians</roleName> of <persName>Edward
            II</persName>. when a minor, in whose reign he was made <roleName>Lord High Admiral</roleName>. He was a formidable part
          of <persName>King Edward</persName>'s power at the battle of <placeName>Bannockburn</placeName>, where he fell, on the <date>24th of June
            1314</date>. His grandson <persName>Robert</persName> was engaged, under the <persName>Black Prince</persName>, in the famous battle of
          <placeName>Cressy</placeName>. <persName>John</persName>, the grand-nephew of the last <persName>Robert</persName>, married the only daughter of <persName>Hotspur
            Percy</persName>, whom <persName>Shakspeare</persName> has made immortal. This <persName>John</persName> was killed at the siege of <placeName>Meaux</placeName> in
          <placeName>France</placeName>. His son <persName>Thomas</persName> gained renown at the battle of <placeName>Poictiers</placeName>, by the stratagem he
          planned, and successfully executed, for taking the town. Snow being on the ground, he and
          his men clad themselves in white, and thus habited, they fell unperceived upon the town,
          and took it. Then came the Wars of the Roses. At the battle of <placeName>Wakefield</placeName>, in which all the
          nobility of <placeName>England</placeName> were engaged on one side or the other, <persName>John, Lord Clifford</persName>, tarnished
          the well-earned fame of his ancestry, by killing, in the pursuit, the youthful <roleName>Earl of
            Rutland</roleName>, son of the <roleName>Duke of York</roleName>, who also fell in tho same battle. But who, says <persName>Speed</persName>,
          can promise any thing of himself in tho heat of martial fury? This barbarous deed was
          perpetrated through revenge, for the <roleName>Earl</roleName>'s father had slain the murderers. He met his
          death in the small valley of <placeName>Dittingdale</placeName> the day before</p>

        <p>Castles of <placeName>Skipton</placeName>, <placeName>Pendragon</placeName>, <placeName>Brougli</placeName>, and <placeName>Appleby</placeName>. In these reparations of the old
          waste places she spent</p>
        <p>the battle of <placeName>Towton</placeName>, leaving a son, named <persName>Henry</persName>, only seven years old at the time of his
          father's death. This child was saved from the rage of the victorious party by concealment.
          For twenty-four years he was deprived of his estate and honours, during which time he
          lived as a <roleName>shepherd</roleName> at <placeName>Barden</placeName> in <placeName>Yorkshire</placeName>, or in <placeName>Cumberland</placeName>, at the estate of his
          father-in-law, <persName>Sir Lancelot Threlkeld</persName>. One of the first acts of <persName>Henry VII.</persName> was to restore
          the <roleName>Shepherd Lord</roleName> to his possessions and dignity. In his retirement he acquired great
          astronomical knowledge, watching, like the <trait type="ethnicity"><label>Chaldeans</label></trait> of old, the stars by night upon the
          mountains. He also possessed some acquaintance with alchemy, and yet he was so illiterate
          when he took his place amongst his peers, as to be unable to write, nor did he ever
          attain higher proficiency in the art, than enabled him to write his name. At the age of
          sixty he went, with a band of followers, to the battle of <placeName>Flodden Field</placeName>; "and there
          shewed," says <persName>Dr. Whitaker</persName>, "that the military genius of the family had neither been
          chilled in him by age, nor extinguished by habits of peace."</p>

          the good <persName>Lord Clifford</persName>'s life, in a noble ode, entitled, "Song at the feast of <placeName>Brougham
            Castle</placeName>." He is mentioned also in a quotation from the Waggoner, already given, and, as the
          reader has just seen, he is not omitted in the "White Doe." The last of this noble family
          was the <persName>Lady Anne Clifford</persName>, the builder up of the waste places, one of the most celebrated
          women of her time. Her <roleName>tutor</roleName> was the "well-languaged" <persName>Daniel</persName>, whose fortunes she was
          instrumental in advancing. She was twice married; the first time to the <roleName>Earl of Dorset</roleName>,
          with whom she led a life of much unhappiness; and then to the <roleName>Earl of Pembroke and
            Montgomery</roleName>, nephew of <persName>Sir Philip Sidney</persName>. "In her first widowhood," says her <roleName>secretary</roleName> and
          <roleName>biographer</roleName>, "she resolved, if God ordained a second marriago for her, never to have one
          that had children, and was a <roleName>courtier</roleName>, a cursor and swearer. And it was her fortune to
          light on one with all these qualifications in the extreme." Notwithstanding all her
          troubles, she was of a high and courageous spirit, not fearing, when she imagined herself
          in the right, either King or Protector. The answer, couched in language of Spartan
          brevity, which she is said to have returned to a ministerial application respecting the
          representation of the borough of <placeName>Appleby</placeName>, is well known. I have been bullied by an
          usurper, I have been neglected by a Court, but I will not be dictated to by a
          subject,--your man shant stand." See the interesting life of <persName>Lady Anne Clifford</persName> in <persName>Hartley
            Coleridge</persName>'s Northern Worthies. This <roleName>author</roleName>, however, agrees with <persName>Lodge</persName> in the opinion that

        <p>Four miles from <placeName>Penrith</placeName>, near the road to <placeName>Appleby</placeName>, and in the district which to this day
          bears the name of <placeName>Whinfell Forest</placeName>, there formerly stood a fine oak, which bore the name of

          place; where, being both spent, the stag leaped over the pales, but died on the other
          side; and the greyhound, attempting to leap, fell, and died on the contrary side. In

        <p>Amongst <persName>Wordsworth</persName>'s sonnets one will be seen founded upon this interesting tradition. In

          One is very large, and contains marks of having been inhabited. There are traces of a door

          The more important are--<placeName>Carleton Hall</placeName>,(<persName>John Cowper, Esq.</persName>,) one mile south-east. <placeName>Brougham
            Hall</placeName>, (<persName>Lord Brougham</persName>,) one and a half miles south-east. <placeName>Skirsgill House</placeName>,</p>

        <p><placeName>BROUGHAM HALL</placeName>, an old and picturesque building, is the seat of <persName>Henry, Lord Brougham and

        <p>eminence not far from the ruins of <placeName>Brougham Castle</placeName>, commanding extensive views of the
          surrounding-country, the mountains beyond <placeName>Ulleswater</placeName> closing the prospect. From its
          situation and beautiful prospects, it has been termed "the Windsor of the North." Having
          at one time belonged to a family named <persName>Bird</persName>, it was from this circumstance sometimes
          called <emph><placeName>Birds Nest</placeName></emph>. The pleasure-grounds and shrubberies are of considerable
          extent and tastefully laid out. In one part is the <placeName>Hermit's Cell</placeName>,--a small thatched
          building containing furniture fitted for, and emblematic of, a <roleName>recluse</roleName>. Upon the table in
          the centre these lines are painted:--</p>

        <p>The family of <persName>Brougham</persName>, (or <persName>Burgham</persName>, as it was formerly spelt,) is ancient and
          respectable. The manor, which bears the same name after having been long alienated, was
          re-acquired, and still belongs to the <persName>Broughams</persName>.</p>

        <p>glass goblet, called the Luck of Edenhall, which would appear, from the following
          traditionary legend, to be wedded to the fortunes of its present possessors. The <roleName>butler</roleName>,
          in going to procure water at a well in the neighbourhood, (rather an unusual employment
          for a <roleName>butler</roleName>,) came suddenly upon a company of fairies, who were feasting and making merry
          on the green sward. In their flight they left behind this glass, and one of them returning
          for it, found it in the hands of the <roleName>butler</roleName>. Seeing that its recovery was hopeless, she
          flew away, singing aloud--</p>

        <p>The <persName>Musgraves</persName> came to <placeName>England</placeName> with the <persName>Conqueror</persName>, and settled first at <placeName>Musgrave</placeName> in
          <placeName>Westmorland</placeName>, then at <placeName>Hartley Castle</placeName> in the same county, and finally at their present
          residence.</p>
        <p><placeName>LOWTHER CASTLE</placeName>, the seat of the <roleName>Earl of Lonsdale, K.G.</roleName>, is seated in a noble park of 600
          acres, on the east side of the woody vale of <placeName>Lowther</placeName>. It was erected by the present <roleName>Earl</roleName>
          upon the site of the old hall which had been nearly destroyed by fire, as far back as the
          year <date>1726</date>, after the designs of the architect <persName>Smirke</persName>. The white stone of which it is
          built, is in pleasing contrast with the vivid green of the park and woods. The effect of
          the whole pile is strikingly grand, worthy the residence of its wealthy and powerful
          owner. The north front, in the castellated style of the <date>13th or 14th century</date>, is 420 feet
          in length. The south front is in the Gothic Cathedral style, and has the usual number of
          pinnacles, pointed windows, &amp;c. So far from the</p>

        <p>diversity of the fronts being discordant, the art of the designer has made them increase
          each others effect--a circumstance not unnoticed by <persName>Wordsworth</persName>, who has a sonnet
          commencing--</p>

        </lg>
        <p>Surmounting the whole is a lofty tower, from the summit of which the prospect is
          extremely fine--the mountains of <placeName>Ilelvellyn</placeName>, <placeName>Seat Sandal</placeName>, <placeName>Saddleback</placeName>, and <placeName>Skiddaw</placeName>, their
          sides probably shadowed</p>
        <l>"By the white mist that dwolls upon the hills,"</l>
        <p>are distinctly visible. The fitting up of the interior is in a style of grandeur
          corresponding with the external appearance. Heart of oak and birch occupy in a great
          measure, the place of foreign woods in the furniture and carvings. The staircase, which
          climbs the great central tower, is highly imposing. Many masterpieces of the old painters
          hang upon the wails, and the corridors and rooms are adorned with busts from the chisels
          of <persName>Chantrey</persName>, <persName>Westmacott</persName> and other sculptors. Amongst these, the bust of our liege <persName>Lady
            Queen Victoria</persName>, taken when she was about six or eight years of age, will be viewed with
          more than ordinary interest. There is also a facsimile of the famous <persName>Wellington</persName> shield,
          carved in solid silver, after the designs of the late <persName>Stothard, R.A.</persName> The different
          compartments exhibit in a regular series, the victories which his <roleName>Grace</roleName> has obtained over

        <p>foes of <placeName>Britian</placeName> in <placeName>India</placeName> and the <placeName>Peninsula</placeName>, but as the shield was executed before the
          battle of <placeName>Waterloo</placeName>, that crowning victory is unfortunately omitted.</p>
        <p>The capabilities of the situation which the park afforded, had been publicly noticed by
          <roleName>Lord Macartney</roleName>, who in describing a romantic scene in the imperial park at <placeName>Gehol</placeName> in <placeName>China</placeName>,
          observed, that "it reminded him of <placeName>Lowther</placeName> in <placeName>Westmorland</placeName>, which, from the extent of
          prospect, the grand surrounding objects, the noble situation, the diversities of surface,
          the extensive woods and command of water, might be rendered by a man of sense, spirit, and
          taste, the finest scene in the British dominions." How far his <roleName>Lordship</roleName>'s views have been
          realized the <roleName>visitor</roleName> will judge. The park has been much admired for the profusion of fine
          forest trees which embellish its banks and braes. It is watered by the <placeName>Lowther</placeName>, the
          pelucid clearness of which, fully justifies its supposed etymological derivation. The grey
          and tree-crowned crags, the transparent stream and the graceful windings of its course,
          add greatly to the charms of its scenery. One portion bears the name of the Elysian
          fields. Near the Castle there is a large grassy terrace shaded by fine trees, from which
          the prospect is most charming.*</p>

          grant of lands in the reign of <persName>Henry II</persName>. The family name is doubtless derived from the
          river, the word being British, and signifying <emph>clear water</emph>. <persName>Sir Hugh de

          <date>1568</date>, he conveyed her by the direction of <persName>Elizabeth</persName>, to <placeName>Carlisle Castle</placeName>. <persName>Sir John Lowther</persName>,
          <roleName>first Viscount Lonsdale</roleName>, distinguished himself by influencing the counties of <placeName>Westmorland</placeName>
          and <placeName>Cumberland</placeName>, in favour of <persName>King William</persName> at the memorable era of <date>1688</date>; in return for
          which service, that <roleName>king</roleName> created him a <roleName>Viscount</roleName> and conferred upon him many other honours.
          <persName>Sir James Lowther</persName>, first <roleName>Earl of Lonsdale</roleName>, succeeded to the three great inheritances of
          <persName>Mauds Meaburn</persName>, <persName>Lowther</persName>, and <persName>Whitehaven</persName>, which came to him by different branches of the
          family. When a <roleName>commoner</roleName>, he was thirty years <roleName>M.P.</roleName> for <placeName>Westmorland</placeName> or <placeName>Cumberland</placeName>, and in
          <date>1761</date> was returned for both counties. He was also <roleName>Lord Lieutenant</roleName> of the two counties, an

        <p>and those who can bear the fatigue of lengthened excursions, will be gratified by a ride
          to <placeName>Hawes Water</placeName>.</p>
        <p>The former lake is generally viewed by <roleName>tourists</roleName> when travelling between <placeName>Ambleside</placeName> and
          <placeName>Penrith</placeName>, as the road between the two places passes along its northern shore. As, however,
          it is a general rule that lake scenery in order to be seen to advantage should be visited
          in a direction opposite to that in which the waters flow, it would be better to invert
          this order of approach. Two roads conduct from <placeName>Penrith</placeName> to <placeName>Pooley Bridge</placeName>, at the foot of
          the lake about six miles distant, both of which lead through a country abounding in
          picturesque scenery. One leaves the <placeName>Keswick road</placeName> two miles and a half from <placeName>Penrith</placeName>, and
          passing through <persName>Mr. Hasell</persName>'s park at <placeName>Dalemain</placeName>, reaches <placeName>Ulleswater</placeName>, three-quarters of a mile
          above <placeName>Pooley Bridge</placeName>. The other road leads along the <placeName>Shap road</placeName> to <placeName>Eamont Bridge</placeName>, shortly
          before reaching which, <placeName>Carleton Hall</placeName> is seen on the left. After crossing the bridge, by
          which <placeName>Westmorland</placeName> is entered, the first road on the right must be taken. In the angle of

        <p>the left at this deviation, is <placeName>King Arthur's Round Table</placeName>, and a little beyond on the
          right is <placeName>Mayborough</placeName>, both of which antique remains have been previously noticed. At
          <placeName>Yanwath</placeName>, two and a half miles from <placeName>Penrith</placeName>, there are the ruins of an ancient hall,
          formerly one of the "noble houses" of <persName>Sir Lancelot Threlkeld</persName>. The road, passing through
          <placeName>Tirrel</placeName> and <placeName>Barton</placeName>, ultimately arrives at <placeName>Pooley Bridge</placeName>, six miles from <placeName>Penrith</placeName>. The <placeName>Eamont</placeName>
          is crossed by a stone bridge upon issuing from <placeName>Ulleswater</placeName>. There are two small inns, at
          which boats upon the lake may be procured. On the west of the village is a steep and
          conical hill, clothed with wood called <placeName>Dunmallet</placeName>, upon which there were formerly the
          vestiges of a <trait type="ethnicity"><label>Roman</label></trait> fortification. Winding walks lead to the summit, from which a fine
          view of the lake is commanded. About half a mile from <placeName>Pooley</placeName>, on the east side of the
          lake, is a villa named <placeName>Eusemero</placeName>, which for some time was the residence of the late <persName>William
            Wilberforce</persName>. From <placeName>Pooley Bridge</placeName> to <placeName>Patterdale</placeName>, a distance of ten miles, the road traverses
          the west margin of <placeName>Ulleswater</placeName>; the lake itself is nine miles in length, and is partitioned
          by the mountains into three separate chambers, or <emph>reaches</emph>, as they are
          locally termed, no two of which can be seen at once from any point near the margin; its
          extreme width is about three quarters of a mile. The first reach, commencing at the foot,
          is terminated on the left by <placeName>Hallin Fell</placeName>, which stretches forward to a promontory, from
          the opposite side called <placeName>Skelley Neb</placeName>, upon which stands <persName>Mr. Marshall</persName>'s house, <placeName>Halsteads</placeName>;
          the middle, and longest reach is closed in by <placeName>Birk Fell</placeName> on the left,</p>

          <placeName>Helvellyn</placeName>," rises into thin air; the little island, called <placeName>House Holm</placeName>, spots the water
          exactly at the termination of this section of the lake. The highest reach is the smallest
          and narrowest, but the mingled grandeur and beauty which surround it, are beyond the power
          of the liveliest imagination to depict; four or five islands dimple the surface, and by
          their diminutive size impress more deeply upon the beholder the vastness of the hills
          which tower above them; <placeName>Stybarrow Crag</placeName>, and other offshoots from <placeName>Helvellyn</placeName> on one side,
          <placeName>Birk Fell</placeName> and <placeName>Place Fell</placeName> on the other, springing from the lake's margin almost at one
          bound, shut in this terrestrial paradise.</p>

        <p>Leaving <placeName>Pooley Bridge</placeName> by the high road, <placeName>Waterfoot</placeName> is passed on the right about a mile
          from the bridge, and <placeName>Rampsbeck Lodge</placeName>, on the left, about two miles from the same place; a
          little further is the village of <placeName>Watermillock</placeName>. So far the lake has lain amongst somewhat
          tame scenery, but here promise is given of its coming grandeur. <placeName>Halsteads</placeName>, the seat of <persName>John
            Marshall, Esq.</persName>, is seen on the left,--the grounds circling which are beautifully laid out.
          The wood at the foot of <placeName>Hallin Fell</placeName>, on the other shore, has a pleasing effect. A mile
          from <placeName>Halsteads</placeName>, <placeName>Gowbarrow Park</placeName> is entered; this park, which contains upwards of a thousand
          acres, must attract the attention of the most careless <roleName>observer</roleName>, by its "grace of forest

        <p>numerable sylvan groups of great beauty still remain, round which herds of deer will be
          seen bounding. It belongs to <persName>Henry Howard, Esq.</persName> of <placeName>Groystock Castle</placeName>, to whom it was
          devised by the late <roleName>Duke of Norfolk</roleName>, his uncle. The <roleName>Duke</roleName>'s predecessor erected upon an
          eminence in the park a hunting-box in the castellated style, which is called <placeName>Lyulph's
            Tower</placeName>; it commands a splendid view of the lake. About five and a half miles from <placeName>Pooley
              Bridge</placeName>, a stream is crossed by a small bridge, a mile above which, in a rocky dell, is a
          waterfall of considerable volume, called <placeName>Airey Force</placeName>. The banks of the stream, which are
          thickly sown with trees, become exceedingly precipitous as the cascade is approached. Two
          wooden bridges are thrown across the stream, one above, the other below, the fall.
          <placeName>Glencoin Beck</placeName>, issuing from <placeName>Linking Dale Head</placeName>, runs under the road a mile beyond <placeName>Airey
            bridge</placeName>, and forms the line of demarcation between <placeName>Cumberland</placeName> and <placeName>Westmorland</placeName>. The highest
          reach of the lake is now unfolded to the view. The road soon afterwards passes under
          <placeName>Stybarrow Crag</placeName>, at which point it has been much widened, formerly it was a narrow path
          between the steep mountain and the water's edge. An <roleName>ancestor</roleName> of the <persName>Mounseys of Goldrill
            Cottage</persName> acquired the title of <emph><persName>King of Patterdale</persName></emph>, from having successfully
          repulsed a body of <trait type="ethnicity"><label>Scotch</label></trait> moss-troopers at this place, with the aid of a few <roleName>villagers</roleName>.
          His residence was at that time <placeName>Patterdale Hall</placeName>, but a few years ago the patrimonial estate
          was sold to <persName>Mr. Marshall</persName> of <placeName>Leeds</placeName>. The brook from <placeName>Glenridding</placeName> is then crossed. <placeName>Helvellyn</placeName>

          distance by the side of <placeName>Glenridding Beck</placeName>. On the left is <placeName>Glenridding House</placeName>, <persName>Rev. Mr.

          afterwards reached. The Churchyard, in which lie interred the remains of the unfortunate
          <persName>Charles Gough</persName>, contains a yew-tree of remarkable size. At the Inn, where there is
          excellent accommodation, <roleName>guides</roleName> may be had to any of the mountains in the vicinity, and
          boats procured for excursions upon the lake. A few days might be pleasantly spent at this
          place, in investigating the hidden beauties of the neighbourhood. There are innumerable
          nooks and shy recesses in the dells and by the lake,</p>
        <p>"Where flow'rets blow, and whispering Naiads dwell"*</p>
        <p>which the leisurely <roleName>wanderer</roleName> has only to see in order to admire. An afternoon might be
          advantageously employed in visiting the islands, of which there are four: <placeName>House Holm</placeName>,
          standing at the mouth of the highest reach, <placeName>Moss Holm</placeName>, <placeName>Middle Holm</placeName>, and <placeName>Cherry Holm</placeName>. <placeName>Place
            Pell Quarry</placeName>, half a mile from the inn, is a good station for viewing the lake; and the
          walk to <placeName>Blowick</placeName>, two farm-houses under <placeName>Place Fell</placeName>, affords many charming prospects. A
          ramble of five or six miles may be taken into the retired valley of <placeName>Martindale</placeName>; nor would
          the hardy <roleName>pedestrian</roleName> have much difficulty in making his way over the fells to <placeName>Hawes

          on the highest part of the pass, breaking in, with its mean associations, upon the solemn
          feelings which the surrounding solitude is calculated to inspire. In descending,

          uncle to the <roleName>Bishop of Lichfield</roleName>, has been the <roleName>teacher</roleName> upwards of sixty years. <placeName>Shap</placeName>, a
          straggling village on the mail road between <placeName>Kendal</placeName> and <placeName>Penrith</placeName>, is five miles distant. The
          road passes near the ruins of <placeName>Shap Abbey</placeName>, lying on the banks of the <placeName>Lowther</placeName>, now bare, but
          once occupied by a thick forest. This abbey, anciently called <placeName>Heppe</placeName>, was founded by
          <persName>Thomas</persName>, the son of <persName>Gospatrick</persName>, for <roleName>monks</roleName> of the <trait type="ethnicity"><label>Premonstratensian</label></trait> order, about the year
          <date>1150</date>. It was dedicated to <persName>St. Magdalen</persName>. Upon the dissolution, the abbey and manor were
          granted to <persName>Thomas Lord Wharton</persName>, from whose descendant, the <roleName>Duke of Wharton</roleName>,* an ancestor
          of the <roleName>Earl of Lonsdale</roleName> purchased them. The only part left standing is the church tower.
          From the vestiges of buildings yet visible, the abbey appears to have been extensive. In
          the vicinity of <placeName>Shap</placeName> are two of those rude structures to which no certain date can be

        <p>parallel lines of unhewn masses of granite, half a mile long by sixty or seventy feet
          broad, terminating at the south extremity in a small circle of similar blocks. Many of the
          granitic blocks have been barbarously carried off for building purposes, or some other
          "base use." At a place called <placeName>Gunnerskeld Bottom</placeName> there is a circle of large stones,
          thought to be a sepulchral cairn.</p>
        <p>Returning to <placeName>Bampton</placeName>, the foot of <placeName>Hawes Water</placeName> is reached, a mile and a half beyond that
          village. The wild wood of <placeName>Naddle Forest</placeName> beautifully feathers the steeps of the east shore.
          Rather more than a mile from the foot of the lake, <placeName>Fordendale brook</placeName> is crossed near a few
          houses, called <placeName>Measand Becks</placeName>. The brook makes some pretty falls on the mountain side. A
          broad promentory enters the lake at this place, and approaches within 200 or 300 yards of
          the other margin. The mountains surrounding the head of this lake present a magnificent
          contour. They consist of <placeName>High Street</placeName> and <placeName>Kidsay Pike</placeName>, with their nameless dependencies.
          The little chapel of <placeName>Mardale</placeName> stands close to the road about a mile above the lake, and
          over against it is a neat white house, called <placeName>Chapel Hill</placeName>, the residence of a <roleName>yeoman</roleName> named
          <persName>Holme</persName>. The <roleName>ancestor</roleName> of this family came originally from <placeName>Stockholm</placeName>, and landed in <placeName>England</placeName>
          in the train of the <persName>Conqueror</persName>. He was rewarded with an estate in <placeName>Northamptonshire</placeName>, where
          the family were seated until the reign of <persName>King John</persName>, at which period, its head flying from
          his enemies, concealed himself in a cavity (to this day called <placeName>Hugh's cave</placeName>) in one of the

          a few houses, called collectively <placeName>Mardale Green</placeName>, (amongst which there is a small inn,) are
          seen thinly sown over the floor of the narrow valley. <placeName>Harter Fell</placeName> closes in this level
          area on the south--lofty mountains rise on the east and west, and contribute to make this
          as perfect a solitude as can well be conceived. The <roleName>pedestrian</roleName> will find a road over the
          pass of <placeName>Gatescarth</placeName>, which reaches <placeName>Kendal</placeName> by the vale of <placeName>Longsleddale</placeName>, fifteen miles from
          <placeName>Mardale Green</placeName>. From <placeName>Mardale</placeName> the <roleName>rambler</roleName> might ascend <placeName>High Street</placeName>, or cross the <placeName>Martindale

        <p>MOUNTAINS.</p>
        <p>The mountains best known and most usually ascended by <roleName>tourists</roleName> are--<placeName>Scawfell</placeName>, <placeName>Helvellyn</placeName>,
          <placeName>Skiddaw</placeName>, <placeName>Coniston Old Man</placeName>, and <placeName>Langdale Pikes</placeName>. <roleName>Guides</roleName> can be procured at any of the
          neighbouring inns, who, for a moderate compensation, will conduct <roleName>strangers</roleName> to the summit
          by the least circuitous path; and being generally intelligent persons, will point out and
          name those objects most worthy of notice, which are visible on the ascent or from the
          highest point. Fine clear days should be selected for an expedition of this kind, as well
          for the advantage of having an extensive prospect, as for safety. Mists and wreaths of
          vapour, capping the summits of mountains, or creeping along their sides, are beautiful
          objects when viewed from the lowly valley; but when the <roleName>wanderer</roleName> becomes surrounded with
          them on the hills, they occasion anything but agreeable sensations, and have not
          unfrequently led to serious accidents. A pocket compass will be found useful in
          discovering the <roleName>tourist</roleName>'s position with reference to the surrounding scenery, and a
          telescope in bringing within view the more distant parts of it. A flask containing brandy,

        <p>the springs on the way, will be found no unnecessary burden. With these preliminary
          observations, we shall proceed to describe the mountains we have named above.</p>
        <p>SCAWFELL.</p>
        <p>The aggregation of mountains, called collectively <placeName>Scawfell</placeName>, which stand at the head of
          <placeName>Wastdale</placeName>, form four several summits bearing separate names. The most southerly of the four
          is <placeName>Scawfell</placeName>, (3100 feet); the next is <placeName>Scawfell Pikes</placeName>, (3160 feet); <placeName>Lingmell</placeName>, of
          considerably inferior elevation, is more to the west, forming a sort of buttress for the
          support of the loftier heights; and <placeName>Great End</placeName> is the advanced guard on the north, having
          its aspect towards <placeName>Borrowdale</placeName>. The whole mass is composed of a species of hard dark slate.
          <placeName>The Pikes</placeName>, being the highest summit in <placeName>England</placeName>, is most commonly the object of the
          <roleName>stranger</roleName>'s ambition; some confusion has, however, been caused by the similarity of names,
          and the lower elevation of <placeName>Scawfell</placeName> been attained, where that of <placeName>Scawfell Pikes</placeName> was
          desired. Since the trigonometrical survey, a pile of stones, surmounted by a staff, has
          been placed on the latter mountain summit; such mistakes, therefore, need not, except
          through carelessness, occur in future.</p>
        <p>The ascent of the two higher mountains may be commenced from several valleys--from
          <placeName>Langdale</placeName>, <placeName>Borrowdale</placeName>, or <placeName>Wastdale</placeName>. Of these, the station from which the ascent may most
          readily be made is</p>

          <roleName>pedestrian</roleName> at the foot of <placeName>Lingmell</placeName>, which projects towards the water. The top of <placeName>Lingmell</placeName>
          being almost gained, a turn must be made to the right, and that direction persevered in
          for three quarters of a mile. Deflections to the right and left in succession will place
          the hardy <roleName>climber</roleName> upon <placeName>Scawfell Pikes</placeName>. From <placeName>Borrowdale</placeName> the best course is to pursue the
          <placeName>Wastdale road</placeName>, until <placeName>Sty Head Tarn</placeName> is reached. Leaving this tarn on the left, and bending
          your way towards <placeName>Sprinkling Tarn</placeName>, which must also be kept on the left, a turn to the right
          must shortly be made conducting to a pass called <placeName>East Haws</placeName>, having on the left <placeName>Hanging
            Knott</placeName>, and on the right <placeName>Wastdale Broad Crag</placeName>. The summit of <placeName>Scawfell Pikes</placeName> is in view from
          this place, but much exertion will be required before either will be reached. <placeName>Great End</placeName>
          will have to be ascended, and continuing along the summit-ridge, some rocky eminences will
          be passed on the left. A considerable descent must then be made, and two small hollows
          crossed, from the second of which the trigonometrical station on the <placeName>Pikes</placeName> will be
          reached. The two elevations of <placeName>Scawfell</placeName> and <placeName>Scawfell Pikes</placeName>, though not more than three
          quarters of a mile distant from each other in a direct line, are separated by a fearful
          chasm, called <placeName>Mickledore</placeName>, which compels a circuit to be made of two miles in passing from
          one to the other. The passage by <placeName>Mickledore</placeName>, though dangerous, is not impassable, as some
          of the adventurous <roleName>dalesmen</roleName> can testify. All vegetation but that of lichens has forsaken

        <p>summits of <placeName>Scawfell Pikes</placeName> and its rival. "Cushions or tufts of moss parched and brown,"
          says <persName>Wordsworth</persName> with his usual poetical feeling, "appear between the huge blocks and
          stones that lie on heaps on all sides to a great distance, like skeletons or bones of the
          earth not needed at the creation, and there left to be covered with never-dying lichens,
          which the clouds and dews nourish and adorn with colours of exquisite beauty. Flowers, the
          most brilliant feathers, and even gems, scarcely surpass in colouring some of those masses
          of stone.</p>
        <p>The view from the <placeName>Pikes</placeName> is, of course, of a most extensive description, embracing such a
          "tumultuous waste of huge hill tops" that the mind and eye alike become confused in the
          endeavour to distinguish the various objects. The mountains having lost the shapes they
          possessed when viewed from beneath, are only to be recognized by those acquainted with the
          locality of each; however, with the aid of his compass, map, and our directions, the
          enquiring gazer will be able to assign its name to most of them. Turning to the south,
          <placeName>Morecambe Bay</placeName> and the <placeName>Lancashire coast</placeName> to a great extent are seen, and on clear days the
          prospect comprehends a portion of the <placeName>Welsh Highlands</placeName>. <placeName>Scawfell</placeName> intercepts the view of
          <placeName>Wast Water</placeName> and part of the <placeName>Screes</placeName>. To the left <placeName>Eskdale</placeName> and <placeName>Miterdale</placeName> are seen contributing
          their waters to the ocean. <placeName>Furness</placeName> and the <placeName>Isle of Walney</placeName> are visible in the same
          direction, as well as <placeName>Devoke Water</placeName>, placed on an elevated moor, beyond which <placeName>Black Combe</placeName>
          is a prominent object. Still more to the east <placeName>Wrynose</placeName>, <placeName>Wetherlam</placeName>, <placeName>Coniston Old Man</placeName>, with

        <p>the mountains at the head of <placeName>Eskdale</placeName>, <placeName>Seathwaite</placeName> and <placeName>Little Langdale</placeName> are conspicuous.
          <placeName>Bowfell</placeName>, obscuring <placeName>Langdale</placeName>, appears in the east, and beyond, part of the middle of

          <placeName>Yewbarrow</placeName>, <placeName>Seatallan</placeName>, and <placeName>Buckbarrow</placeName>. The <placeName>Irish sea</placeName> bounds the whole western horizon, and

        <p>than any other, partly from its easiness of access, and its proximity to a turnpike road,
          over which a coach passes daily within a mile and a half of the summit, and partly in
          connection with a melancholy accident which some years ago befell a <roleName>stranger</roleName> upon it,
          whose fate, the elegiac verses of <persName>Wordsworth</persName> and <persName>Scott</persName> have contributed to make
          universally lamented. It stands, the highest of a long chain of hills, at the angle formed
          by the vales of <placeName>Grasmere</placeName>, <placeName>Legberthwaite</placeName>, and <placeName>Patterdale</placeName>, about half way between <placeName>Keswick</placeName>

          map-like view of the whole <placeName>Lake district</placeName>, no fewer than six lakes being visible from its
          summit, whilst the circumjacent mountains present themselves in fine arrangement. Its
          height is 3055 feet above the level of the sea, being something more than a hundred feet
          lower than <placeName>Scawfell Pikes</placeName>, and higher than <placeName>Skiddaw</placeName> by thirty-three feet. Its geological
          structure is slate in one part and in another a flinty porphyry.</p>
        <p>The ascent of <placeName>Helvellyn</placeName> can be effected from several quarters. <placeName>Grasmere</placeName>, <placeName>Legberthwaite</placeName>,
          <placeName>Wythburn</placeName>, and <placeName>Patterdale</placeName>, severally afford advantageous points for the commencement of the
          escalade, the two latter, however, lying in diametrically opposite directions, are the
          places where it is usually begun. It may be well perhaps to mention that ponies can be
          used for a great portion of the way if the lowland be quitted at <placeName>Grasmere</placeName>, a facility, of
          which none of the other paths will admit. The ascent from <placeName>Wythburn</placeName>, though the shortest,
          is the steepest. A <roleName>guide</roleName></p>

          discovered without his assistance, many persons will feel inclined to dispense with this
          restraint upon their motions and conversation. The path, which begins to ascend almost at
          the inn door, will be pointed out by the people of the inn. A spring called <placeName>Brownrigg's
            Well</placeName>, issuing from the ground within three hundred yards of the summit, sends out a
          stream, which, after rushing violently down the mountain's side, crosses the highway 200 or
          300 yards from the <placeName>Horse's Head</placeName> at <placeName>Wythburn</placeName>. Taking this stream as a guide, the <roleName>stranger</roleName>
          need have no fear of losing his way, for <placeName>Helvellyn Man</placeName> is a little to the left, at the
          distance we have mentioned, above its source. In the ascent a small sheet of water called
          <placeName>Harrop Tarn</placeName>, will be seen under <placeName>Tarn Crag</placeName>, a lofty precipice on the opposite side of the
          receding valley. The scars, seams and ravines</p>

        <p><placeName>Red Tarn</placeName>, may be taken as a guide up the mountain. This tarn lies 600 feet immediately
          below the highest elevation, fenced in on the south-east by a ridge of rock called
          <placeName>Striding Edge</placeName>, and on the north-west by a similar barrier called <placeName>Swirrel Edge</placeName>.
          <placeName>Catchedecam</placeName>, the termination of the latter, must be ascended, and the ridge crossed in
          order to attain the object of the <roleName>climber</roleName>'s ambition. Although the path along this ridge
          may be somewhat startling, there is no real danger to be apprehended. Sometimes, from
          mistake or fool-hardiness, <placeName>Striding Edge</placeName> is taken, but this is at once appalling and
          perilous, for at one part the path is not more than two yards broad, with a tremendous
          precipice on either side. It was at this spot that <persName>Charles Gough</persName> met with the accident

        <p>mit is called—thence to gaze on the wonderful display of mountains and lakes which every
          where surround him. This <placeName>Man</placeName>, and that on a lower elevation, to the north, form the
          separating landmarks between <placeName>Cumberland</placeName> and <placeName>Westmorland</placeName>. And now as to the view, and the
          multitudinous objects within its range. Northwards, <placeName>Keppel Cove Tarn</placeName> is perceived, having
          on the right <placeName>Catchedecam</placeName>. Beyond the extremity of the tarn <placeName>Saddleback</placeName> rears its huge form,
          a little to the loft of which is <placeName>Skiddaw</placeName>. Between the two, and in the north-west, a
          portion of the <placeName>Solway Firth</placeName> is descried, and the extreme distance is bounded by the
          <placeName>Scottish mountains</placeName>. Turning eastwards the <placeName>Red Tarn</placeName> below its "huge nameless rock", lies
          between <placeName>Swirrel Edge</placeName> on the left and <placeName>Striding Edge</placeName> on the right. Beyond is the crooked
          form of <placeName>Ulleswater</placeName>, on the loft margin of which are <placeName>Gowbarrow Park</placeName> and <placeName>Stybarrow Crag</placeName>,
          whilst the right is hounded by the dwindled precipices of <placeName>Place Fell</placeName>, <placeName>Beck Fell</placeName>, and
          <placeName>Swarth Fell</placeName>. <placeName>High Street</placeName> and <placeName>High Bell</placeName> are seen in the east over <placeName>Striding Edge</placeName>. <placeName>Kirkstone</placeName>,
          <placeName>Fairfield</placeName>, and <placeName>Dolly Waggon Pike</placeName> are more to the south. A portion of <placeName>Windermere</placeName> is seen
          over the last named hill, whilst in a clear atmosphere <placeName>Lancaster Castle</placeName> can be descried
          beyond <placeName>Windermere</placeName>. <placeName>Esthwaite water</placeName> is directly south, and beyond is the sea in the <placeName>Bay of
            Morecambe</placeName>. In the south-west the <placeName>Old Man</placeName> stands guarding the right shore of <placeName>Coniston Lake</placeName>.
          On the fight is the assemblage of hills termed <placeName>Coniston Fells</placeName>, whilst <placeName>Black Combe</placeName>, beheld

          <placeName>Great Gable</placeName>. The gorgeous pavilions of the <placeName>Buttermere mountains</placeName> are pitched in the west,
          amongst which the <placeName>Pillar</placeName> and <placeName>Grasmoor</placeName> are prominent. <placeName>Cat Bells</placeName> are visible, though
          <placeName>Derwentwater</placeName>, upon the west margin of which they stand, is hidden. Our old acquaintance
          <placeName>Honister Crag</placeName> may be seen in a hollow, a little to the left of <placeName>Cat Bells</placeName>. From the lower
          <placeName>Man</placeName> views of <placeName>Thirlemere</placeName> and <placeName>Bassenthwaite Lake</placeName> are commanded, both of which are concealed
          by a breast of the mountain from those on the highest <placeName>Man</placeName>.</p>

        <p>As this mountain stands at the head of an extensive valley, apart from the adjacent
          eminences, its huge bulk and great height are more strikingly apparent than those of the
          two former, although of inferior altitude to either of them. It is extremely easy of
          access, so much so, that ladies may ride on horseback from <placeName>Keswick</placeName> to the summit, a
          distance of six miles. According to the <roleName>Government surveyers</roleName>, its height is 3022 feet
          above the sea; upon one part of it granite is to be found, but the great mass of this
          mountain, as well as of <placeName>Saddleback</placeName>, is composed of a dark schistose stone. It is seldom
          ascended from any other place but <placeName>Keswick</placeName>, at which town every thing necessary for the
          expedition will be furnished. The <placeName>Penrith road</placeName> must be pursued for half a mile, to a
          bridge which spans</p>

        <p><placeName>the Greta</placeName> just beyond the turnpike gate. Crossing the bridge, the road passes <placeName>Greta Bank</placeName>,
          and skirts <placeName>Latrigg</placeName>, at an elevation sufficient to command delightful views of <placeName>Keswick
            vale</placeName>. "This road," says <persName>Green</persName>, "is unequalled for scenic beauty in the environs of
          <placeName>Keswick</placeName>." Traversing a plantation of wood, it enters another road, upon which the <roleName>visitor</roleName>,
          turning to the right, must proceed for a few yards only, as, just beyond a gate across the
          way, the road to be taken turns to the left at right angles, by the side of a fence, to a
          hollow at the foot of the steepest hill on the ascent, having on the right a deep ravine,
          down which a transparent stream is seen falling. The path then holds along for about a
          mile by the side of a wall, which it crosses, and proceeds in a direct line forward,
          whilst the wall diverges to the right. A large and barren plain, called <placeName>Skiddaw Forest</placeName>, in
          the middle of which there is a spring of beautifully clear water, is then traversed for a
          mile, leaving a double-pointed elevation, called <placeName>Skiddaw Low Man</placeName>, the highest summit on
          the left; <placeName>Skiddaw Man</placeName>, will then be ascended.</p>
        <p>Many persons prefer the views which they obtain during the ascent to that from the
          summit, and reasonably so, if <emph>beauty</emph> of scenery be sought for. A view will
          always be indistinct in proportion as it is extensive. Nothing can exceed the charming
          appearance of the valley and town of <placeName>Keswick</placeName>, of <placeName>Derwentwater</placeName> and its surrounding
          eminences, when beheld from the mountain's side; the lake especially, with its bays and
          islands, is nowhere seen to such advantage. In consequence of <placeName>Skiddaw</placeName> being ex-</p>

        <p>posed to the blasts of the west wind from the <placeName>Irish Channel</placeName>, the <roleName>visitor</roleName> will not be
          inclined, from the intense cold, to stay long on the summit; we shall therefore proceed to
          run over hastily the names of the principal objects which are visible from that elevated
          position. In the north, beyond the lowlands of <placeName>Cumberland</placeName>, in which <placeName>Carlisle</placeName> and its
          cathedral are perceived, the <placeName>Solway Frith</placeName> is seen, on the further side of which the
          <placeName>Scottish mountains</placeName> are displayed in fine arrangement. <placeName>Criffell</placeName> is seen over <placeName>Skiddaw Far
            Man</placeName>, and the <placeName>Moffat and Cheviot hills</placeName> stretch away to the right. <placeName>Dumfries</placeName> is visible at
          the mouth of the frith. In the north-west, over <placeName>High Pike</placeName> and <placeName>Long Brow</placeName>, the vale and town
          of <placeName>Penrith</placeName> are beheld, with <placeName>Cross Fell</placeName> (2901 feet) beyond. Directly east is the rival
          summit of <placeName>Saddleback</placeName>, separated by the tract called <placeName>Skiddaw Forest</placeName> from the mountain on
          which the <roleName>spectator</roleName> is standing. <placeName>Helvellyn</placeName> is in the south-east; beyond, <placeName>Ingleborough</placeName> in
          <placeName>Yorkshire</placeName> is dimly descried. Between <placeName>Helvellyn</placeName> and <placeName>Saddleback</placeName>, <placeName>Place Fell</placeName>, at the head of
          <placeName>Ulleswater</placeName>, and <placeName>High Street</placeName> are visible. When the atmosphere is clear, <placeName>Lancaster Castle</placeName>
          may be seen in the southeast. <placeName>Derwentwater</placeName> is not comprehended in the view from the
          highest man, being concealed by some of the other eminences of <placeName>Skiddaw</placeName>, but from the third
          man a perfect bird's-eye prospect of that lake is obtained. In the south "there is a
          succession of five several ranges of mountain seen out-topping each other, from a stripe
          of the lovely valley to the highest of the <placeName>Pikes</placeName>. <placeName>Grisedale</placeName> in one grand line stretches
          from the inclosures at <placeName>Braithwaite</placeName> to its</p>

        <p>Pike, succeeded in the second range by <placeName>Barrow Stile End</placeName>, and <placeName>Utterside</placeName>. Rising from the
          fields of <placeName>Newlands</placeName>, the third range commences with <placeName>Rolling End</placeName>, ascending from which are
          <placeName>Causey Pike</placeName>, <placeName>Scar Crag</placeName>, <placeName>Top Sail</placeName>, <placeName>Ill Crags</placeName>, and <placeName>Grasmoor</placeName>, the latter lessening the <placeName>Pike of
            Grisedale</placeName> by appearing over its top. The fourth line in this wild combination is composed
          of <placeName>Cat Bells</placeName>, <placeName>Maiden-moor</placeName>, <placeName>Dalehead</placeName>, <placeName>Hindsgarth</placeName>, <placeName>Robinson</placeName>, <placeName>High Crag</placeName>, <placeName>High Stile</placeName>, and <placeName>Red
            Pike</placeName>. The fifth and last is that sublime chain of summits, extending on the south from
          <placeName>Coniston</placeName>, to <placeName>Ennerdale</placeName> on the north; amongst these the <placeName>High Pike or Man</placeName>, standing towering
          over the rest, has on the left <placeName>Great End</placeName>, <placeName>Hanging Knott</placeName>, <placeName>Bow Fell</placeName>, and the <placeName>Fells of

          <placeName>Black Sail</placeName>. On the right of <placeName>Grisedale Pike</placeName> and <placeName>Hobcarten Crag</placeName> is <placeName>Low Fell</placeName>, succeeded by
          <placeName>Whinfield Fell</placeName>, over which, in a clear atmosphere, may be observed more than the
          northern half of the <placeName>Isle of Man</placeName>; and on a mistless sunny evening, even <placeName>Ireland</placeName> may be

        <p>This mountain stands at the north-west angle of <placeName>Coniston Lake</placeName>, from the eastern shore of
          which it presents a magnificent appearance. It is 2577 feet in height, forming the highest
          peak of the range called <placeName>Coniston Fells</placeName>. It is composed of a fine roofing slate, for the
          excavation of which there are several large quarries. The slates are carried down the lake
          by means of boats, and, at its termination, are carted to <placeName>Ulverston</placeName>. There are also some

        <p>The most eligible mode of ascending the <placeName>Old Man</placeName> is to leave the village of <placeName>Coniston</placeName> by
          the <placeName>Walna Scar road</placeName>, and, pursuing the way along the common for a few hundred yards, to
          take a path which will be seen to climb the mountain side on the right. This path leads
          directly up to <placeName>the Man</placeName>, finely built on the edge of a precipice overhanging <placeName>Low Water</placeName>.
          There is a fine open view to the south, embracing the estuaries of <placeName>the Kent</placeName>, <placeName>Levon</placeName>, and
          <placeName>Duddon</placeName>, a long line of coast, and, in serene weather, the <placeName>Isle of Man</placeName>. <placeName>Snowdon</placeName> may be
          distinguished on a very clear day. It appears a little to the left of <placeName>Black Combe</placeName>, over
          <placeName>Millum Park</placeName>. In the home views the eye will be attracted by <placeName>Coniston Lake</placeName>, the whole
          length of which is immediately below the <roleName>spectator</roleName>. A part of <placeName>Windermere</placeName> can be seen more
          to the east. On other sides <placeName>the Old Man</placeName> is surrounded by high mountains, which wear an

          difficult to ascend. They are conspicuous objects from the upper end of <placeName>Windermere</placeName>, and
          from the road leading from <placeName>Kendal</placeName> to <placeName>Ambleside</placeName>. They are usually ascended during the
          <placeName>Langdale</placeName> excursion, (as to which see page 26,) but <roleName>pedestrians</roleName> would have no difficulty in
          making the ascent from <placeName>the Stake</placeName>, or from <placeName>Grasmere</placeName> through <placeName>Easdale</placeName>. The easiest mode,
          however, is that from <placeName>Langdale</placeName>. A <roleName>guide</roleName> can be procured at <placeName>Milbecks</placeName>, where <roleName>Tourists</roleName>
          commonly take some refreshment. The path pursues a peat road leading to <placeName>Stickle Tarn</placeName>, well
          known to the <roleName>angler</roleName> for its fine trout, which lies under a lofty ridge of rock called
          <placeName>Pavey Ark</placeName>. This tarn must be left on the right, and a streamlet which runs down the hill
          side taken as a guide. The path becomes at this part exceedingly steep, but a little
          patient exertion will soon place the <roleName>Tourist</roleName> on the summit of <placeName>Harrison Stickle</placeName>. Though of
          considerably inferior elevation to the other mountains we have described, the views from
          this spot are extremely fine. Looking eastward, <placeName>Helvellyn</placeName>, <placeName>Seat Sandal</placeName>, and <placeName>Fairfield</placeName>
          bound the prospect; and, in the north-west and north, <placeName>Skiddaw</placeName> and <placeName>Saddleback</placeName> are seen in
          the distance. <placeName>Stickle Tarn</placeName> is immediately below the eye, guarded by the frowning heights
          of <placeName>Pavey Ark</placeName>. In the south-east are the hills around the valley of <placeName>Ambleside</placeName>, beyond those
          at the head of <placeName>Troutbeck</placeName> and <placeName>Kentmere</placeName>. In turning to the south, the eye is attracted by

          <placeName>Loughrigg Fell</placeName> conceals a portion of the head of the lake as well as the town of

        <p>This Inn is pleasingly situate in the margin of the lake; boats, post-horses, and guides,
          can be supplied. A few days might be spent agreeably here,</p>
        <p>the excursions In the vicinity are numerous. The Old Man is in the immediate
          neighbourhood ; its ascent, though a work of toil, would highly gratify the Tourist. A
          walk into the narrow valleys of Yewdale and Tilberthwaite, will afford many grand scenes.
          Newfield, in the retired vale of Scathwaite, can be reached by the Walnn Scar road, which
          passes through Church Coniston, and under the Old Man. This road, which is very
          mountainous and rough, is six miles in length.</p>
        <p>Blelham Tarn.</p>
        <p>Pull Wyke, a hay of Windermere, here makes an advance. Wansfell Holm, G. Warden, Esq.,

        <p>Water Park, Benson Harrison, Esq. Fine view of the mountains round the head of the
          lake.</p>
        <p>From an eminence near the highest promontory, a beautiful view of the lake may be
          obtained. On the opposite shore, are the dark Fells of Torver. Further up, Coniston Hall,
          surrounded with trees, is descried. This hall has changed owners but twice since the
          Conquest, most of which time it has belonged to the Flemings. Beyond are the towering
          Fells of Coniston. Just below, is the rocky islet, Peel.</p>
        <p>This lake, called also Thurston Water, is six miles long, and nearly three-quarters of a
          mile broad, its depth is stated to be 162 feet. Its margin is very regular, having few
          indentations of any magnitude. 'Two small islands are situate near the eastern shore. Its
          principal feeders are the streams from Yewdale and Tilberthwaite, and those running from
          the tarns on the Man Mountain. It abounds with trout and char; the latter fish is thought to
          be found in greater perfection here than elsewhere. The scenery at the foot is tame, but
          that at the upper extremity is of the grandest description. The Old Man, (2577 feet,) and
          Wetherlam, (2400 feet) aro extremely majestic. The greatest</p>
        <p>portion of the lake belongs to Lady le Fleming of Rydal Hall, who has some valuable
          copper mines upon the Old Man.</p>
        <p>Fine view of the Rydal and Ambleside Mountains.</p>

        <p>This lake is two miles in length, and one-third of a mile in breadth. The scenery around
          it is pleasing, but destitute of any features of grandeur. A peninsula swells from the
          west shore, and pleasantly relieves the monotonous regularity of the margin. The stream
          which issues from it, is called the Cunsey; it enters Windermere a mile and a half below
          the Ferry. Many handsome villas enliven the banks of the lake. In a pond near the head, is
          a diminutive floating island, having upon it several small trees.</p>
        <p>At the termination of the ascent, the lake and vale of Coniston, hemmed in by magnificent

          Dunmail Raise gap.</p>
        <p>Hawkshead is a small but ancient market-town at the head of the valley of Esthwaite. The
          old hall where the Abbots of Furness held their Courts, is a farmhouse, lying about a
          mile distant. St. Michael's Church, a structure of great antiquity, is placed on a rocky

        <p>IV. CIRCUIT OF WINDERMERE.</p>
        <p>WE have deferred entering upon any description of this Queen of the Lakes, until we could
          at the same time detail the route which forms a circuit round its margin. We would by all
          means recommend those <roleName>strangers</roleName> who have sufficient time to circumambulate this lake,
          which is the largest sheet of water in the district, to do so at an early period of their
          visit, that the quiet scenery with which it is surrounded may not be considered tame, as
          will probably be the case if the survey be delayed until the bolder features of the
          country have been inspected.</p>
        <p><placeName>Windermere</placeName>, or more properly <placeName>Winandermere</placeName>, is about eleven miles in length, and one mile
          in breadth. It forms part of the county of <placeName>Westmorland</placeName>, although the greatest extent of
          its margin belongs to <placeName>Lancashire</placeName>. It has many feeders, the principal of which is formed by
          the confluence of <placeName>the Brathay</placeName> and <placeName>Rothay</placeName> shortly before entering the lake. The streams
          from <placeName>Troutbeck</placeName>, <placeName>Blelham Tarn</placeName>, and <placeName>Esthwaite Water</placeName> also pour in their waters at different
          points. Numerous islands, varying considerably in size, diversify its surface at no great
          distance from one another, none of them being more than four and a half miles from the
          central part of the lake. Their names commencing with the most northerly are—<placeName>Rough Holm</placeName>,

        <p>wens or <placeName>Belle Isle</placeName>, (round which are several nameless islets,) <placeName>Berkshire Island</placeName>, (a
          little below the Ferry points,) <placeName>Ling Holm</placeName>, <placeName>Grass Holm</placeName>, and <placeName>Silver Holm</placeName>. <placeName>Windermere</placeName> is
          deeper than any of the other lakes, with the exception of <placeName>Wast Water</placeName>, its depth in some
          parts being upwards of 240 feet. It is plentifully stocked with perch, pike, trout, and
          char, which last, at the proper season, is potted in large quantities and forwarded to the
          south. It is a remarkable fact, that at the spawning season, when the trout and char leave
          the lake, the former fish invariably takes <placeName>the Rothay</placeName>, and the latter <placeName>the Brathay</placeName>.</p>
        <p>The prevailing character of the scenery around <placeName>Windermere</placeName> is soft and graceful beauty. It
          shrinks from all approach to that wildness and sublimity which characterise some of the
          other lakes, and challenges admiration on the score of grandeur only at its head, where
          the mountains rise to a considerable height, and present admirable outlines to the eye of
          the spectator. The rest of the margin is occupied by gentle eminences, which, being
          exuberantly wooded, add a richness and a breadth to the scenery which bare hills cannot of
          themselves bestow. Numerous villas and cottages, gleaming amid the woods, impart an aspect
          of domestic beauty which further contributes to enrich the character of the landscape.
          Around the shores of the lake there are many places which may be made the temporary
          residence of the <roleName>tourist</roleName> while exploring the beauties of the adjacent country, and
          probably he may find it advantageous to make several of them his abode in succession:</p>

        <p>GUIDE TO THE LAKES.</p>
        <p><placeName>Ambleside</placeName>, one mile beyond the head of the lake; <placeName>Low Wood Inn</placeName>, a mile and a half from its
          head on the east shore; <placeName>Bowness</placeName>, also on the east shore, half way between the two
          oxtromitics, and, therefore, perhaps, the most eligible; the <placeName>Ferry Inn</placeName> on the promontory
          over against <placeName>Bowness</placeName>; and <placeName>Newby Bridge</placeName> at its foot, all furnish comfortable quarters for
          the <roleName>tourist</roleName>, where boats, <roleName>guides</roleName>, and all his other wants can he supplied.</p>
        <p>We shall commence our perambulation at the town first named, proceeding along the west
          border, and returning by the east border of the water. Passing <placeName>Croft Lodge</placeName>, (<persName>James
            Brancker, Esq.</persName>) on the right, <placeName>Brathay Bridge</placeName> is crossed at <placeName>Clappersgate</placeName>, one mile from
          <placeName>Ambleside</placeName>, and shortly afterwards <placeName>Brathay Hall</placeName>, (<persName>G. Redinayne, Esq.</persName>) is seen on the left.
          A bay, called <placeName>Pull Wyke</placeName>, there makes a deep indentation; and looking across the lake,
          <placeName>Wansfell Holm</placeName>, <placeName>Low Wood Inn</placeName>, and lower down, <placeName>Calgarth</placeName>, the seat of the late <persName>Bishop Watson</persName>,
          are pleasing objects. <placeName>Wansfell Pike</placeName> and the <placeName>Troutbeck Hundreds</placeName> tower above them. The road
          to <placeName>Hawkshead</placeName> having deviated to the right, the village of <placeName>High Wray</placeName> is gained, five miles
          from <placeName>Ambleside</placeName>; and three miles beyond is the <placeName>Ferry Inn</placeName>. At this place the shores suddenly
          contract, and between the two promontories a public ferry is established, by means of
          which <roleName>passengers</roleName>, cattle, and vehicles are conveyed across the lake at a trifling charge.
          About the year <date>1635</date>, a marriage was celebrated at <placeName>Hawkshead</placeName>, between a wealthy <roleName>yeoman</roleName> from
          the neighbourhood of <placeName>Bowness</placeName>, and a <roleName>lady</roleName> of the family <persName>Sawrey</persName> of</p>

        <p><placeName>Sawrey</placeName>. As is still customary in <placeName>Westmorland</placeName> amongst the rustic population, the married
          couple were attended by a numerous concourse of friends, some of whom were probably more
          than cheerful. In conducting the bridegroom homewards, and crossing the ferry, the boat
          was swamped, either by an eddy of wind or by too great a pressure on one side, and thus
          upwards of fifty persons, including the bride and bridegroom, perished. While at the <placeName>Ferry
            Inn</placeName>, the <roleName>tourist</roleName> should not fail to visit <placeName>the Station</placeName>, a pleasure house belonging to <persName>Mr.
              Curwen</persName> of <placeName>Bolle Isle</placeName>, standing on a spot whence fine views of the circumjacent scenery are
          commanded. "The view from <placeName>the Station</placeName>," says <persName>Professor Wilson</persName>, "is a very delightful one,
          but it requires a fine day. Its character is that of beauty, which disappears almost
          utterly in wet or drizzly weather. If there be strong bright sunshine, a 'blue breeze'
          perhaps gives animation to the scene. You look down on the islands which are here very
          happily disposed. The banks of <placeName>Windermere</placeName> are rich and various in groves, woods, coppice,
          and cornfields. The large deep valley of <placeName>Troutbeck</placeName> stretches finely away up to the
          mountains of <placeName>High Street</placeName> and <placeName>Hill-Bell—hill</placeName> and eminence are all cultivated wherever the
          trees have been cleared away, and numerous villas are visible in every direction, which,
          although not perhaps all built on very tasteful models, have yet an airy and sprightly
          character; and, with their fields of brighter verdure and sheltering groves, may be fairly
          allowed to add to, rather than detract from, the beauty of a scene, one of whose chief
          charms is that it is the cheerful abode of</p>

        <p>social life." At a short distance from the land is <placeName>Belle Isle</placeName>, upon which stands</p>
        <p>"A <trait type="ethnicity"><label>Grecian</label></trait> temple rising from the deep"—</p>
        <p>the residence of <persName>H. Curwen, Esq.</persName> The island is rather more then a mile in circumference,
          containing upwards of thirty acres. Neat walks, over which fine trees throw their massive
          arms, intersect the island, which in high floods is cut in two. <roleName>Strangers</roleName> are allowed to
          land; and as the views are extremely pleasing, they should avail themselves of the
          privilege. The village of <placeName>Bowness</placeName> is a pretty object on the east margin of the lake.* One
          mile and a half</p>
        <p>*This island was formerly the property and residence of the <persName>Philipsons</persName>, an ancient
          <placeName>Westmorland</placeName> family, who were also owners of <placeName>Calgarth</placeName>. During the civil war between
          <persName>Charles I.</persName> and the Parliament, there were two brothers, both of whom had espoused the
          royal cause. The cider, to whom the island belonged, was a <roleName>Colonel</roleName>, and the younger a
          <roleName>Major</roleName> in the royal army. The latter was a man of high and adventurous courage; and from
          some of his desperate exploits had acquired amongst the <roleName>Parliamentarians</roleName> the appellation
          of <persName>Robin the Devil</persName>. It happened when the <roleName>king</roleName>'s death had extinguished for a time the
          ardour of the <roleName>cavaliers</roleName>, that a certain <persName>Colonel Briggs</persName>, an officer in <persName>Oliver</persName>'s army,
          resided in <placeName>Kendal</placeName>, who having heard that <persName>Major Philipson</persName> was secreted in his brother's
          house on <placeName>Belle Isle</placeName>, went thither armed with his double authority, (for he was a <roleName>civil
            magistrate</roleName> as well as a <roleName>military man</roleName>—</p>
        <lg type="stanza">
          <l>Great on the bench, great in the saddle,</l>
          <l>Mighty he was at both of these,</l>
          <l>And styled of War as well as Peace,)</l>
        </lg>
        <p>with the view of making a prisoner of so obnoxious a person. <roleName>The Major</roleName>, however, was on
          the alert, and gallantly withstood a siege of eight months until his brother came to his
          relief. The attack being thus repulsed, <roleName>the Major</roleName> was not a man who would sit down quietly
          under the injury he had received. He therefore raised a small band of horse and set forth
          one Sunday morning in search of <persName>Briggs</persName>. Upon arriving at <placeName>Kendal</placeName>, he was informed that the
          <roleName>Colonel</roleName> was at prayers. Without further consideration he proceeded to the church, and
          having posted his men at the entrance, dashed forward himself down the principal aisle
          into the midst of the assemblage. Whatever were his intentions—whether to shoot the
          <roleName>Colonel</roleName> on the spot, or merely to carry him off prisoner—</p>

        <p>from the <placeName>Ferry Inn</placeName>, the stream called <placeName>Cunsey</placeName>, which runs from <placeName>Esthwaite Water</placeName>, is
          crossed. At a short distance from the place where this stream joins the lake, is the
          island called <placeName>Ling Holm</placeName>. On the opposite margin, the <placeName>Storrs promontory</placeName> is seen</p>
        <p>they were defeated: his enemy was not present. The congregation was at first too much
          surprised to seize <roleName>the Major</roleName>, who, in discovering that his object could not be effected,
          galloped up the next aisle. As he was making his exit from the church, his head came
          violently in contact with the arch of the door-way, which was much smaller than that
          through which he had entered. His helmet was struck off by the blow, his saddle girth gave
          way, and he himself was much stunned. The congregation, taking advantage of the confusion,
          attempted to seize him; but with the assistance of his <roleName>followers</roleName>, <roleName>the Major</roleName> made his
          escape after a violent struggle and rode back to his brother's house. The helmet still
          hangs in one of the aisles of <placeName>Kendal</placeName> church. This incident furnished <persName>Sir Walter Scott</persName> with
          a hint for his description of a similar adventure in Rokeby, canto vi.</p>

          of which is <placeName>Graithwaite Hall</placeName>, (<persName>J. J. Rawlinson, Esq.</persName>) From this place to <placeName>Newby Bridge</placeName> the
          road passes through a woodland section of the country, consisting chiefly of coppices. As
          the foot of the lake is approached, it narrows rapidly and becomes truly</p>

        <p><placeName>Landing</placeName>, (<persName>John Harrison, Esq.</persName>,) is passed on the left shortly before reaching <placeName>Newby
          Bridge</placeName>, at which there is a comfortable inn. The stream which issues from the lake takes
          the name of <placeName>the Leven</placeName>. From this place to the principal towns in the neighbourhood, the
          distances are:—<placeName>Ulverston</placeName>, eight miles. <placeName>Kendal</placeName>, by way of <placeName>Cartmell Fell</placeName>, ten miles—by
          <placeName>Levens Bridge</placeName>, fifteen miles. <placeName>Ambleside</placeName>, by the road we have described, fifteen miles.
          <placeName>Bowness</placeName>, nine miles. On crossing the bridge, <persName>Mr. Machell</persName>'s neat residence is seen on the
          right, and further on, <placeName>Fell Foot</placeName>, (—<persName>Starkie, Esq.</persName>,) is passed on the left; a short
          distance beyond, <placeName>Town Head</placeName>, (<persName>Wm. Townley, Esq.</persName>,) is near the road on the left, about two
          miles from <placeName>Newby Bridge</placeName>. The road passes under an eminence of the <placeName>Cartmell Fell</placeName> chain,
          called <placeName>Gummer's How</placeName>, which forms a conspicuous object in all views from the upper end of

          of the late <persName>John Bolton, Esq.</persName>, seated amongst fine grounds which extend to the margin of

        <p>owner. Here <persName>Mr. Canning</persName> was wont to pay frequent visits, withdrawing for a time front the

          <placeName>Burnside</placeName>, (<persName>G. A. Aufrere, Esq.</persName>,) and <placeName>Belle Field</placeName>, (<persName>Mark Beaufoy, Esq.</persName>,) are successively
          passed immediately before <placeName>Bowness</placeName> is entered. This pretty village is placed on the edge of
          a large bay, opposite <placeName>Belle Isle</placeName>, about eight miles from <placeName>Kendal</placeName>, and six from <placeName>Ambleside</placeName>.

          gave peculiar interest.</p>
        <p>"A large company had been assembled at <persName>Mr. Bolton</persName>'s seat in honour of the minister-it
          included <persName>Mr. Wordsworth</persName> and <persName>Mr. Southey</persName>. It has not, I suppose, often happened to a plain
          <roleName>English merchant</roleName>, wholly the architect of his own fortunes, to entertain at one time a
          party embracing so many illustrious names. He was proud of his guests; they respected him,
          and honoured and loved each other ; and it would have been difficult to say which star in
          the constellation shone with the brightest or the softest light. There was 'high
          discourse,' intermingled with as gay flashings of courtly wit as ever <persName>Canning</persName> displayed;
          and a plentiful allowance on all sides of those airy transient pleasantries in which the
          fancy of <roleName>poets</roleName>, however wise and grave, delights to run riot when they are sure not to be
          misunderstood. There were beautiful and accomplished women to adorn and enjoy this circle.
          The weather was as Elysian as the scenery. There were brilliant cavalcades through the
          woods in the mornings, and delicious boatings on the lake by moonlight; and the last day,
          <persName>Professor Wilson</persName> ('<persName>the Admiral of the Lake</persName>,' as <persName>Canning</persName> called him) presided over one of
          the most splendid regattas that ever enlivened <placeName>Windermere</placeName>. Perhaps there were not fewer
          than fifty barges following in the <persName>Professor</persName>'s radiant procession when it paused at the
          point of <placeName>Storrs</placeName> to admit into the place of honour the vessel that carried kind and happy
          <persName>Mr. Bolton</persName> and his guests. The three bards of the lakes led the cheers that hailed <persName>Scott</persName>
          and <persName>Canning</persName>; and music, and sunshine, flags, streamers, and gay dresses, the merry hum of
          voices, and the rapid splashing of innumerable oars, made up a dazzling mixture of
          sensations as the flotilla wound its way among the richly-foliaged islands, and along bays
          and promontories peopled with enthusiastic <roleName>spectators</roleName>.</p>

        <p>the village for making excursions, are much frequented during the touring season. The
          Church, dedicated to <persName>St. Martin</persName>, is an ancient structure with a square tower, and a finely
          painted chancel window, which originally belonged to <placeName>Furness Abbey</placeName>. The churchyard
          contains a monument erected to the memory of <persName>Richard Watson</persName>, the late learned <roleName>Bishop</roleName> of
          <placeName>Llandaff</placeName>, the <roleName>author</roleName> of "the Apology for the Bible," and other well known works. He was
          born at <placeName>Heversham</placeName>, in another part of the county, in which village his father was
          <roleName>schoolmaster</roleName> for upwards of forty years. He was interred at this place: the inscription
          upon his tomb is simple and unpretending. "<persName>Ricardi Watson</persName>, Episcopi Landavensis, cineribus
          sacrum obiit Julii 1. A.D. <date>1816</date>, Ætatis 79." The interior of the Church may be described
          in these lines, taken from "the Excursion," which have doubtless been suggested by this,
          or a similar structure.</p>

        <p>The school-house has been lately rebuilt through the munificence of the late <persName>Mr. Bolton</persName>
          of <placeName>Storrs</placeName>. It stands on an eminence to the east of the village, and forms a handsome
          edifice. The view from the front is exquisitely beautiful, comprising the whole of the
          upper half of the lake. The mountains round the head, into the recesses of which the
          waters seem to penetrate, arrange themselves in highly graceful forms, and the wooded
          heights of the opposite shore cast a deep shadow upon "the bosom of the steady lake." From

        <p>Several interesting walks will be pointed out to <roleName>strangers</roleName>, amongst which we may mention

          take the trouble to proceed about half a mile along the road to <placeName>Brant Fell</placeName>, he will be
          rewarded by one of the finest views of the lake he can obtain. <placeName>The Fells of Furness</placeName> are

          will be particularized presently:) turn to the right, and keep on this road for about a
          mile. <placeName>The Wood</placeName>, <placeName>St. Catherines</placeName>, and <placeName>Elleray</placeName>, are passed on the left. The last is the
          property of <persName>Professor Wilson</persName> of <placeName>Edinburgh</placeName>, but at present it is occupied by <persName>Thomas
            Hamilton, Esq.</persName>, the <roleName>author</roleName> of <persName>Cyril Thornton</persName>, of a history of the Peninsular Campaigns,
          and other literary Works. The house is perched upon the hill-side, having beautiful views
          of the surrounding scenery visible from its windows. It is thus alluded to in one of the
          poems of its owner.</p>

        <p>A narrow lane branches off from the <placeName>Kendal road</placeName> near the <placeName>Orrest Head gate</placeName>, by which
          <placeName>Bowness</placeName> will be reached one mile and a half from <placeName>Orrest Head</placeName>.</p>
        <p>The more distant excursions will include the valley of <placeName>Troutbeck</placeName>,* the circuit of the two
          sections of <placeName>Windermere</placeName>, <placeName>Esthwaite Water</placeName>, and <placeName>Coniston Lake</placeName>. These are but a few, but an
          inspection of the chart will suggest others.</p>
        <p>Quitting <placeName>Bowness</placeName> for <placeName>Ambleside</placeName>, the stately woods of <placeName>Rayrigg</placeName> are entered three quarters
          of a mile from the former place. A bay of the lake is then seen to project almost to the
          road. <placeName>Rayrigg House</placeName> stands</p>

        <p>on the left near the water's edge; shortly before emerging from the wood the road ascends
          a steep hill and then pursues a level course, affording from its terrace a magnificent
          view of the lake—a view to which, says <persName>Wilson</persName>, "there was nothing to compare in the
          hanging gardens of <placeName>Babylon</placeName>. There is the widest breadth of water—the richest foreground of
          woodand the most magnificent background of mountains, not only in <placeName>Westmorland</placeName>, but—believe
          us—in all the world." Our old acquaintances, the two <placeName>Pikes of Langdale</placeName>, are easily
          recognized. On the left is <placeName>Bowfell</placeName>, a square topped hill, between which and <placeName>the Pikes</placeName>,
          <placeName>Great End</placeName> and <placeName>Great Gable</placeName> peep up. On the left of <placeName>Bowfell</placeName> the summit of <placeName>Scawfell Pike</placeName> is
          faintly visible. The road is intersected two miles from <placeName>Bowness</placeName> by the <placeName>Kendal and
            Ambleside road</placeName>, at a place called <placeName>Cook's House</placeName>, nine miles from <placeName>Kendal</placeName>. A road proceeds
          into <placeName>Troutbeck</placeName> in a line with the one over which we have been conducting the <roleName>tourist</roleName>. From
          <placeName>Cook's House</placeName> to <placeName>Troutbeck Bridge</placeName> is almost a mile. From this place a road conducts by the
          west bank of the stream to the village of <placeName>Troutbeck</placeName>, the nearest part of which is a mile
          and a half distant. Continuing our progress towards <placeName>Ambleside</placeName>, <placeName>Calgarth</placeName>, embosomed in
          trees, is passed on the left. The late <persName>Bishop Watson</persName> built this mansion, and resided here
          during the latter years of his life; it is still occupied by his descendants. Two miles
          beyond is <placeName>Low Wood Inn</placeName>, which, standing pleasantly on the margin of the lake at its
          broadest part, is an excellent station for those who are able to devote a few days to the
          beauties of the neighbourhood. Most of the excur-</p>

        <p>sions recommended to be made from <placeName>Ambleside</placeName> may, with almost equal advantage, be
          performed from this inn. Close at hand is <placeName>Dove's Nest</placeName>, the house <persName>Mrs. Piemans</persName> inhabited
          one summer. Her description of the place, taken from her delightful letters, will not be
          deemed uninteresting:—"The house was originally meant for a small villa, though it has
          long passed into the hands of <roleName>farmers</roleName>, and there is, in consequence, an air of neglect
          about the little demesne, which does not at all approach desolation, and yet gives it
          something of touching interest. You see everywhere traces of love and care beginning to be
          effaced—rose-trees spreading into wildness—laurels darkening the windows with too
          luxuriant branches; and I cannot help saying to myself, 'Perhaps some heart like my own in
          its feelings and sufferings has here sought refuge and repose.' The ground is laid out in
          rather an antiquated style; which, now that nature is beginning to reclaim it from art, I
          do not at all dislike. There is a little grassy terrace immediately under the window,
          descending to a small court, with a circular grass plot, on which grows one tall white
          rose-tree. You cannot imagine how much I delight in that fair, solitary, neglected-looking
          tree. I am writing to you from an old fashioned alcove in the little garden, round which
          the sweet briar and the rose-tree have completely run wild; and I look down from it upon
          lovely <placeName>Winandermere</placeName>, which seems at this moment even like another sky, so truly is every
          summer cloud and tint of azure pictured in its transparent mirror.</p>

        <p>"I am so delighted with the spot, that I scarcely know how I shall leave it. The
          situation is one of the deepest retirement; but the bright lake before me, with all its
          fairy barks and sails, glancing like things of life over its blue water, prevents the
          solitude from being overshadowed by anything like sadness." <placeName>Wansfell Holm</placeName>, (<persName>George Warden,
            Esq.</persName>) is seen on the right, immediately before reaching the head of <placeName>Windermere</placeName>. The road
          for the last three or four miles has been alternately approaching to and receding from the
          margin of the lake, but never retiring further from it than a few fathoms. At <placeName>Waterhead</placeName> is
          the neat residence of <persName>Mr. Thomas Jackson</persName>, and further on, <placeName>Waterside</placeName>, (<persName>Mr. William Newton</persName>,)
          is passed on the left. <placeName>Ambleside</placeName>, the termination of our perambulation of twenty-nine
          miles, is entered one mile beyond.</p>

              <p>Eagle Crag is seen hanging over the upper end of the lake, a sheet of water,
                environed by frowning precipeces, two and a half miles long, 500 feet above the
                level of the sea, and about 100 feet in depth. There is a small island near the
                shore at its foot. It is so narrow as to allow a wooden bridge to be thrown across
                its middle. To obtain some picturesque views, the lake should be crossed by this
                bridge, and the road on the west shore taken, which joins the turnpike road, a
                little beyond the twelfth mile-stone. Raven Crag is a fine object near the foot.

        <p>***The whole of this route is seldom travelled continuously; but as most of it will be
          traversed in detached portions, it has been thought better to place the total distance
          under one description, from which the Tourist may elect the sections he requires. In
          consequence of there being no inn at which post-horses are kept between Ambleside and
          Calder Bridge, carriages cannot pursue this route.</p>

        <p>*Egromont is a neat market town, containing about 1600 inhabitants, seated at the
          distance of two miles and a half from the coast, upon the banks of the Ehen, the stream
          which flows from Ennerdale Lake. It is stated to have been a borough at the period when
          Parliamentary representatives were remunerated for their services; and that, to avoid the
          expense of a member, the burgesses petitioned to have the burgh disfranchised, which was
          accordingly done. The Parish Church is on ancient edifice, dedicated to St Mary. It was
          granted by William de Meschiens to the Cell of St Bees- Upon an eminence to the west of
          the town stand the ruins of Egremont Castle, formerly a place of great strength and
          importance. It was built by the above named William do Meschiens soon after the Norman
          Conquest. In the lapse of time it passed into the possession of the Lucy family. There is
          a tradition respecting the fortress whilst belonging to the Lucies, which Wordsworth has
          versified in some stanzas entitled, The Horn of Egremont Castle." General Wyndham is the
          present owner of both the Manor and Castle of Egremont. Large quantities of iron ore are
          excavated in the neighbourhood, which are conveyed to Whitehaven unsmelted, and thence
          shipped to South Wales. St Bees, at which there is a fine Conventual Church, is two and a
          half miles distant. A good road, of seven miles in length, conducts to the foot of
          Ennerdale Lake. The distances from Egremont to the neighbouring towns arc, Raven-glass, 11
          miles; Broughton, 20 miles; Ulverston, 30 miles; Cockermouth, 13 miles; Maryport, 20
          miles.</p></div>

        <p>141</p>
        <p><placeName>COCKERMOUTH</placeName> is an ancient borough and neat market-town of 4500 <roleName>inhabitants</roleName>, seated at the
          junction of the <placeName>Cocker</placeName> with the <placeName>Derwent</placeName>, from which circumstance it derives its name. It
          sent two <roleName>representatives</roleName> to <placeName>Parliament</placeName> as early as the <date>twenty-third year of <persName>Edward I.</persName></date>,
          and, by the Reform Act, it has still the privilege of returning two <roleName>members</roleName>. The honour
          and <placeName>castle of Cockermouth</placeName> belong to <persName>General Wyndham</persName>. The ruins of this ancient fortress,
          formerly a place of great strength, are seated on a bold eminence which rises from the
          <placeName>east bank of the Cocker</placeName>. It was built soon after the <trait type="ethnicity"><label>Norman</label></trait> Conquest by <persName>Waldieve</persName>, first
          <roleName>lord of Allerdale</roleName>, of whose <roleName>successors</roleName> it was for many centuries the baronial seat. In
          <date>1648</date>, it was garrisoned for <persName>King Charles</persName>, but being afterwards taken by the
          <roleName>Parliamentarians</roleName>, was dismantled by them, and has ever since lain in ruins, except a small
          part which the late <persName>Earl of Egremont</persName> sometimes inhabited. The <placeName>Gateway Tower</placeName>, embellished
          with the arms of the <persName>Umfravilles</persName>, <persName>Multons</persName>, <persName>Lucies</persName>, <persName>Percies</persName>, and <persName>Nevilles</persName>, is a striking
          object. On the north side of the town is a tumulus, called <placeName>Toots Hill</placeName>; one mile to the
          west are the remains of a rampart and ditch of an encampment, 750 feet in circuit, called
          <placeName>Fitt's Wood</placeName>. On the summit of a hill at <placeName>Pap Castle</placeName>, a village one mile and a half
          south-west of <placeName>Cockermouth</placeName>, are the traces of a <trait type="ethnicity"><label>Roman</label></trait> castrum. A great number of antique
          remains have been discovered at this place, and in the neighbourhood. The castle was
          subsequently the residence of the above-mentioned <persName>Waldieve</persName>, by whom it was demolished, and
          the materials used in the construction of <placeName>Cockermouth Castle</placeName>. <persName>Tickell</persName>, the <roleName>poet</roleName>, <persName>Addison</persName>'s
          friend, was born at <placeName>Bridekirk</placeName>, two miles distant.*</p>

            <cell><p>Strands is a pretty little village with two inns. The tourist making it his
                head quarters for a few days, will find many pleasant excursions in the vicinity.
                The view of Wast Water commanded from Latterbarrow, a rocky hill in the
                neighbourhood, is extremely fine. A curious ravine called Hawl Gill, in the
                south-east extremity of the Screes, is worth a visit; and those who are fond of
                mountain rambles, may pass along the summit of the Screes and descend to Wastdale
                Head. The views from this elevated situation are magnificent.</p></cell>

                Two wooden bridges are thrown across the brook, one above the other, below the fall.
